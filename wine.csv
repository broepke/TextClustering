US,"This wine spent time in French, American and Hungarian oak, 25% of it new. It offers a classically herbal expression of the variety, exhibiting notes of black olive and leather over fruity tones. Tight and grippy, it needs to open over time to let the aromas catch up on the palate.",,86,17,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt
US,"Made from mostly Merlot grapes that went direct-to-press to preserve color and tannin, this is a dark, pink and nutty wine, full-bodied and somewhat intense. While dry, the fruit leans toward the tangy end of the spectrum. It's food friendly and thirst quenching.",Bell Mountain Estate,87,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Medlock Ames

US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is aged 43 months in new French oak. The oak is indeed dominant here, enveloping more subdued layers of savory leather, dark berry and cassis.

US,"Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine suffered from the cold vintage. The wine is tannic and acidic, and the cherry and currant flavors are modest. The winery did its best to install elegance, and succeeded, but it's a wine to air and drink now.",Symmetry Red,86,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Rodney Strong
US,"This shows the fleshiness of Merlot. But it's also enormously tannic, with a mouth-numbing astringency, and the finish is severely dry. With black cherry and herb flavors, it wants an hour or two in the decanter, but it's not an ager.",,86,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Pech Merle
US,"This is a skin-contact wine, fermented on skins for a week, that displays the technique in its dark golden color. From there, it's ripe in a sweetness of baked pear, honey and dried apricot, while lean on the palate despite the fleshy nature of the fruit.",Ellis Alden Vineyard,86,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Judge Palmer
US,"This is a 100% varietal wine, aged for 32 months, with one-quarter of the barrels being new oak. Grippy in red currant and cranberry, it has a thickness of tannin and slightly bittersweet, tobacco-like finish.",Warnecke Ranch,86,47,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sutro
US,"Strong, caramelized oak stars in this dry, rather one-dimensional Cabernet. Despite some black currant, anise and mocha flavors, it's like drinking toothpicks.",Winemaker's Reserve,84,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Souverain

US,"This tastes like melted milk chocolate and blackberry jam spread on buttered cinnamon toast, drizzled with some anisette liqueur and sprinkled with black pepper. It's lusty, robust, high in alcohol and sweet, and it will pair well with barbecue.",Estate Bottled,87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,La Storia
US,"This is a seriously good Cabernet. You can stand it against anything in California and it will acquit itself with pride. It shows the soft tannins and herbaceousness of Alexander Valley, but is rich in blackberries, cherries and mocha, with a long, spicy finish. The result is a deliciously complex wine, dry, full-bodied and rich. Drink now–2016.",Mavericks Goosechase Vineyard,92,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"This wine is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Malbec. It shows the big, hard tannins of both varieties, as well as their dryness and intense blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. The 100% new French oak is in balance with the size of the underlying fruit. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015, and it should still be providing pleasure in 2021.",Nicole's,92,115,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Lancaster
US,"Seghesio's Home Ranch Zin is dependably ripe and blended with a little Petite Sirah for structure. The palate is soft and rather sweet with flavors of black cherry and raspberry, along with hints of mocha, bacon and toasty oak. It should hold for many years but is unlikely to gain complexity so drink now–2014.",Home Ranch,92,58,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"This polished young wine shows the softness and slight herbaceousness that mark many Alexander Valley Cabernets. With ripe blackberry, cherry pie, red currant and mocha flavors, it's a fine wine to drink now and over the next 4–5 years.",Estate Grown,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reynoso
US,"Exuberant in red fruit, this is a softly textured Zinfandel, high in acidity with evolved tannins. Layered, complex and food-friendly, the imprint of red berry and brambly blackberry juiciness is joined by swirls of nuanced vanilla and a touch of oak. There's a sprinkling of black pepper on the palate, too.",Nance's Vineyard,90,29,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ousterhout
US,"Very ripe and extracted, this has flavors of blackberries and cherries that are a bit heavy-handed. There's a lot of oak influence, too, which adds to the heaviness.",Marlstone,86,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos du Bois
US,"The line between tart gooseberries and that strong ammonia smell is a thin one. This Sauvignon Blanc steps just over the edge. The price is fine, and the wine is dry and crisp in citrus fruit flavors, but it is a little too green.",,84,14,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Souverain
US,"Here's a very rich, elaborate wine that defines the modern, ripe style of Zinfandel. You certainly can't complain about the fruit, which is massive in red and black berry and stone fruit flavors, sprinkled with black pepper, cinnamon and star anise. It's a little hot and sweet in alcohol, but then again, this is an Alexander Valley Zin.",Estate,90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"Softer and lighter than the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine's fruit veers toward red fruits and berries. It shows the herbaceous quality that often marks the winery's red wines. Drink now.",Wetzel Family Estate,87,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Rich and easy, this has jammy raspberry, cherry, milk chocolate, anise and sandalwood flavors. Earns extra points for the velvety texture and smooth, spicy finish.",Cooney Vineyard,86,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Huntington
US,"Good price for this smooth Merlot. It's very frontal in flavor, with a taste of chocolate-covered cherry candy, but it's dry, with a lingering finish.",,87,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt
US,"So smooth and lush, it's hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle. Shows wonderfully smooth, sweet blackberries, cherries and raspberries, balanced with supple tannins and fine acidity. Should hold well over the next six years.",Bear Point,90,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet

Drink now.",Wetzel Family Estate,87,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"So ripe in fruit, it's almost sweet, with jammy flavors of blackberries, black cherries, blueberries, milk chocolate and sandalwood.

US,"Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role. It's really an elegant wine and a great value at this price.",Block Collection Walking Tree,91,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"Tannic and jammy now, showing ripe, freshly crushed blackberry, cherry and blueberry flavors liberally accented with smoky oak. A bit direct and obvious, but the tannins are thick, and the wine could age.",Estate,87,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stryker Sonoma
US,"So rich, deeply flavored and heady, it's almost like a dessert Port, although it's dry, not sweet. The blackberry and cherry flavors taste like they were baked into cookies. As you'd expect from a Petite Sirah, the tannins are thick, but nothing you can't drink now with barbecue.",La Storia,88,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Trentadue
US,"From vineyards quite high up in the eastern mountains, this wine is from stressed, low-yielding grapes. The blackberry and cassis flavors are concentrated and dense, and the tannins are tough and firm. Oak plays a supporting role. Rich foods, such as lamb or gongonzola cheese, will soften and sweeten it, but you're best off cellaring for a few years.",Alden Vineyards,91,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"The best Alexander Valley Chardonnays, such as this, show flamboyant tropical flavors. Capture's '09 shows ripe, extravagant pineapple, mango, papaya, nectarine and lime fruit, with a grilled quality baked into a pastry dessert. It's a big wine framed by fine acidity. The oak appliqué is just about perfect.",Ma Vie Carol,92,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Capture

US,"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points. The flavors are wrapped in soft, easy but complex tannins. Fully dry and nicely oaked, this wine is immediately enjoyable.",Winemaker's Reserve,90,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Château Souverain
US,"Sweet stuff, with flavors of butterscotch, vanilla and custard. The basic fruit flavors are peaches and pears. No problem getting the grapes superripe in this warm California region. Nice on its own as a sipper, or good with barbecued scallops in a rich butter sauce.",Wetzel Family Estate Reserve,87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Alexander Valley Vineyards

Drink now.",Alexander's Crown,90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"A challenging wine, made all the more so because there's a beautiful entry and the wine has truly delicious aspects. It's softly complex and beguiling, with cherry custard, vanilla and smoky oak flavors, and shows real finesse. On the other hand, the short finish suggests it's not going anywhere, so drink up.",Estate,89,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lancaster
US,A lively blend of citrus and baked-apple flavors that are clean and spicy on the finish.  Simple and fresh.,Dry,85,9,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chenin Blanc,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices. The wine is fully dry, with finely meshed tannins, but the main quibble is that it's too soft to be completely balanced.",,88,48,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Ledson
US,"This long-anticipated wine from a longtime grower-turned-vintner swings for the fences. Begins with fascinating, complex aromas—highlighted by lees, pineapple, cinnamon, smoke and white chocolate—and dazzles with its sheer opulence. Everything comes together in pinpointed harmony, right down to the mind-bogglingly beautiful finish.",,96,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Young
US,"This is a wine that aims for lean elegance. It shows a balance of cherry, herb and leather flavors, and is pretty tannic. Drink now.",,85,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Elaine Maria
US,"Light in flavor, this friendly, everyday Chard shows modest peach, spice and oak flavors and a creamy texture.",,84,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Geyser Peak
US,"Reserve Alexandre is always a really nice, interesting wine, but with recent price increases, consumers should be wary. The '04 shows classic Alexander Valley softness and herbs, along with cherries, blackberries and oak, and it's an elegantly balanced wine. But it doesn't seem to be an ager, as it's a little thin on the finish, so drink now.",Reserve Alexandre Meritage,87,56,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Geyser Peak
US,"This isn't a very complex Merlot, but it is textbook if you're looking for soft fruitiness. It has oak-influenced cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of violets and fruit tea, and is dry and dusty in tannins. Give it more concentration and it would be a star.",,87,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Geyser Peak
US,"Sebastiani knows how to make good Cabernet. It's wired into their hard drive, and with this lovely '07, they've again succeeded. The wine is dry, elegant and drinkable now with upscale fare.

US,"After struggling with this vineyard for a number of years, Joe Benziger seems to have gotten a handle on this finicky mountain fruit. Even in this so-so vintage, the wine is complex and pleasurable, although tannic. Hold until 2008.",Vineyard Collection Ash Creek Vineyard,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Imagery
US,"The alcohol is nice and modest on this dry wine, and it has a pleasantly soft feeling as you sip it. Then there are the cherry and herb flavors that are complex and appealing.

US,"Made from mountain grapes, this is an extraordinarily rich, concentrated young Cabernet Sauvignon.

US,"A great Bordeaux-style wine that can stand proudly next to Napa bottlings that cost far more. It's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four permitted Meritage varieties, and there seems to be lots of new, sweetly toasted oak.

US,"Too soft for comfort, and too sweet, although the softness may exaggerate the true sugar content. Either way, this simple wine has cloying, candied blackberry and mocha flavors.",Special Reserve,83,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
US,"This is a good wine to drink if you want a modestly elegant Chardonnay to serve alongside food, instead of a big, oaky sweetie. It's dry and crisp and clean, with pleasantly rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples, minerals and vanilla. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.",Estate,87,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, with pineapple and orange jam flavors and oak-like vanilla and caramel influences.",,83,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,DeLorimier
US,"Lots of delicious charm in this soft, slightly sweet Pinot Noir. Brims with raspberry, cherry, cola, vanilla, cinnamon and spice flavors that are balanced with a crisp edge of acidity. Drink now.",Wetzel Family Estate,87,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Made, they say, from century-old vines, this is one of the more concentrated, intensely flavored Zins out there. It's massive, detonating in the mouth with pure, vibrant cherry, blackberry and sweet dark chocolate fruit. The spices, ranging from black and white pepper to cinnamon and clove, are as much a part of the profile as the fruit.",Big River Ranch,91,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"Currants, black and red, are the dominant flavors of this drily elegant wine. You'll also find notes of briary blackberries and dark, unsweetened baker's chocolate. Best in the next few years before it loses fruity freshness.",,87,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lake Sonoma
US,"It's no disrespect to say this is a great family restaurant-style Merlot. Tens of millions of Americans dig into beef at the neighborhood joint, and they want a good red to drink alongside it. At this price, this is that wine. It's soft and rich with blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a finish of sweet, toasty oak.",,89,17,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt
US,"It's a clash of the titans now, with massively ripe blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors battling a battalion of oak and tannins for supremecy. It's a good wine—rich and soft in the Alexander Valley way—but unresolved. Try giving it 4–5 years in the cellar.",Estate,89,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stryker Sonoma
US,"A little brusque in texture, with some tartness, but there's a lot of richness. Shows complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, black currants, cola, dark bitter chocolate, cedar and spices, with a pleasant minerality, and the finish is bone dry. Brisk tannins make it an ideal companion to roasted meats and hard cheeses. Production was 47,000 cases.",Estate,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Shows Viognier's exotic side in the tropical mango and papaya fruit flavors, while oak barrels bring in smoky caramel notes. With refeshing acidity, it's an appealing wine. Sharp acidity gives it a cutting feel.",,86,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Wattle Creek
US,"Rich and fruity, this Cabernet Sauvignon is filled with ripe blackberry, black currant and spice flavors. It's a little angular and tannic,  so it might benefit from a few years in a cellar.",Ellen's Vineyard,87,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Aje
US,"A solid Petite Sirah. You can use it in a wine education class as a textbook example of the variety. It's full bodied, tannic and rich in blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis, cola, grilled meat and black pepper flavors, enhanced by oak. Should age effortlessly, without gaining complexity, for many years.",Brown Barn Vineyard,90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,J. Rickards
US,"You'd likely never peg this as either Grenache or Alexander Valley. With a light, crisp mouthfeel and pure flavors of cherries and pomegrantes, it's likeable for its dry silkiness, and ready to drink now.",Sceales Vineyard,88,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Grenache,Hobo
US,"Despite some richly extracted blackberry and black currant flavors, this wine's tannins and acids are out of whack. They give the wine a sharp, hard mouthfeel, and it actually turns bitter instead of spicy on the finish. Ready now.",Five Sisters Blend,86,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Rickards
US,"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter.",,88,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stryker Sonoma
US,"Rich and oaky, this wine's buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors are the main attraction. You'll also find a pineapple-orange jam note, plus a vanilla-like sweetness.",Belle Terre Vineyard,86,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean

US,"A rich, decadent and generous wine, 100% varietal, this is both floral and fruity, bright in cherry and raspberry alongside herbal cedar and vanilla. A medium weight surrounds softly integrated tannins, leading the way to an explosive, juicy finish. This is a classic example of the appellation's prowess in approachable power.",Yoeman Vineyard,93,85,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"Quite full bodied and obviously powerful in flavor, this wine is piled deep and rich with fruit aromas and flavors like ripe blackberries and blueberries plus chocolate and espresso. An impressive, astringent texture adds structure and makes it appetizing to drink, while the tannins seem to help the opulent flavors linger during the aftertaste.",Big River Ranch,93,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"They can't call the grapes old vine, because the vineyard is only 15 years old. But it was planted from clones that constituted an old vineyard that contained Petite Sirah, Carignane, Mataro and Alicante Bouschet. The wine is robust and rustic, with bright, briary berry fruit and spice flavors that will stand up well against any roasted meats.",Ancestor Selections,88,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,J.

US,"If you like tart, green gooseberries in your white wines, this is for you. It has that rather vegetal, feline flavor, alongside riper lemons and limes that finish basically dry and crisp.",Croft Vineyard,83,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,J. Rickards
US,"Good for everyday drinking, this Cabernet has smooth, dusty tannins. The black cherry, tobacco and herb flavors are ready to drink now.",,85,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Picket Fence
US,"From high-elevation blocks once devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon, this exceptionally crafted wine reveals a worthwhile trade-off, flavors celebratory in pear and peach. Fragrant and floral, it offers zesty acidity in Meyer-lemon form, finishing in lasting waves of more lemon.",Estate,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Stonestreet
US,"A sound, fruity, if rustic Zinfandel. It's soft and slightly sweet, with candied blackberry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper, licorice and spice flavors, and a coating of caramelized oak.",Ancestor Selections Vineyard,83,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,J. Rickards
US,"Made in the drier, leaner, earthier and more Chablisian style that's increasingly popular, this Chardonnay is a natural for food pairings, such as shellfish. It's a minerally wine, with elegant citrus, kiwi and pear flavors and a streamlined complexity.",Estate,91,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"This is a big, dramatically tannic Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's full-bodied, mouth-filling power, as well as blackberry, coffee, beef jerky and sandalwood flavors that finish rich and long. Should live for many years, gradually softening and sweetening.",Todd Brothers Ranch,90,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Dashe Cellars
US,"For those looking for a leaner, earthier but still-stylish Cabernet, this is the ticket. It's very dry, with soft Alexander Valley tannins and flavors of blackberries, cherries and herbs. This elegant young wine could easily develop fascinating bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.",Estate,90,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"A great Bordeaux-style wine that can stand proudly next to Napa bottlings that cost far more. It's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four permitted Meritage varieties, and there seems to be lots of new, sweetly toasted oak. The blackberry, cherry, red currant, mocha and bacon flavors are delicious, but even better is the tannic structure. It's soft and alluring enough to drink now.",Symmetry Red,94,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Rodney Strong
US,"Robust and spicy, with a soft, juicy mouthfeel framing Zinny flavors of wild cherries, mulberries and briary blackberries. It's pretty tannic, and calls for rich, greasy barbecue.",Tood Brothers Ranch Old Vines,87,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"A tough, green wine, with minty sharp acidity and not much fruit, although you'll find some modest cherry flavor.",,82,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Praxis
US,"Hard mountain tannins characterize this Cab, which was grown above 2,000 feet in the Mayacamas. It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring. Best 2012–2018.",Christopher's,96,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",,96,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy
US,"Notable for its richness and concentration of fruit, and also for the finesse of the tannin structure. Feels softly lush and luxurious, with potent blackberry and cherry-pie filling, raspberry liqueur, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood flavors. Needs time to resolve its elements. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar.",Oliver's Blend,92,105,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Skipstone
US,"Showing the intensely concentrated flavors of low-yielding old vines, this Zin is dense and rich in wild blackberry, briary blueberry, black pepper and cola flavors, with curious tastes that must come from the minerals in the earth. It's a bit rustic, but who cares? Break out your best grilled meats and poultry and savor this wine, if you can find it. Production was only 320 cases.",Old Vine 1908 Brignoli Vineyard,90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,J. Rickards
US,"Drew used to release this bottling some 16 or 17 months after the vintage. This wine has been rushed to market at barely more than a year of age. As a result, this young wine shows the ripe flavors and structural integrity of earlier vintages, such as the wonderful 2007, but it's rude in jam and acids. If you buy it, do what the winery should have: store it for at least an additional year, and better yet, three.",Fog-Eater,90,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Drew
US,"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.",Vyborny Vineyard,95,70,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"A beautiful wine, lush and appealing and at its best for the next 5–7 years. It's soft but enormously rich and smooth in tannins, with deep, extracted flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants, bacon, licorice, cola, dried herbs and sandalwood. Grows smoother and more complex as it warms in the glass.",Oliver's Blend,92,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Skipstone
US,"Enormously rich and complex in blackberry tart, black currant, crème de cassis, licorice and bacon flavors. The tannins are strong but very fine, with a velvety texture. Give it 5–6 years to achieve bottle complexity.",Oliver's Blend,92,95,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Skipstone
US,"With soft tannins, gentle acidity and herbal flavors of blackberries and cherries, this dry Cabernet displays classic Alexander Valley character. It's a little simple now, but should develop interesting bottle complexities over the years.",Winemaker's Reserve,89,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Souverain
US,"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6–8 years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.",Redwood Ranch,93,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Joseph Jewell
US,"Big, tough, gutsy, fruity, tannic. In other words, Petite Sirah, and classic at that.

Good now, and should develop over a decade.",Staten Family Reserve,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Field Stone
US,"Always an interesting wine, and one that's made to drink with food. Dry and balanced, it shows flavors of blackberries, herbs and oak, with a soft, velvety mouthfeel. Made from all five of the traditional Bordeaux varieties, it should evolve over the next 6–8 years.",Cyrus,92,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"This is a softly sophisticated Cabernet that will please fans of the variety who want a wine that's a little earthier than your riper Napa Valley versions. It has herb and tobacco flavors, but there's also a delicious sunburst of sweetly ripe cherries right in the middle that lasts through the finish. Should develop over the next 7–8 years.",Five Sisters Blend,89,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Rickards
US,"A bit tough and chewy, with jagged tannins, and the oak feels like it was imposed upon the wine. The black cherry, currant and chocolate flavors are pleasant enough. Ready now.",,86,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano
US,"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.",Lot 119,87,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Cameron Hughes

Medium bodied, it has a mix of elegance and decadence that makes it drinkable now and impressive from start to finish.",,91,37,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,The Calling
US,"Soft and gentle and fruity-sweet, this easy-drinking Zin has upfront flavors of pie-filling cherries and raspberries, sprinkled with cocoa, cinnamon, pepper and vanilla. Delicious now; production was only 511 cases.",Todd Brothers Ranch Old Vines,89,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"Here's a soft, spicy, gentle Syrah meant for drinking now with roast beef, pork and chicken dishes. Sausages will be particularly nice. The wine brims with berries, cherries, pepper, mocha, violets and sandalwood.",Wetzel Family Estate,87,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Dryness and herba notes mark this wine. Despite some rich oak influences, it comes down on the mineral and sage side, only vaguely suggesting fruitier notes of pineapples and peaches.",Stuhlmuller Vineyards Reserve,86,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Summers
US,"Too sweet for balance. Tastes like sugared blackberry and cherry jam, enriched with caramelized oak. The tannin structure is very fine, but the wine needs to be drier and less obvious.",,85,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"Bone dry, this wine shows the soft, dusty tannins and herbal flavors that classically mark Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. It has an elegant structure housing flavors of blackberries, currants, sage, tobacco and cedar, and should develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.",,87,70,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Silver Oak
US,"A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years.",Reserve,87,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mantra
US,"Made in the simple modern style of lots of caramelized oak and sweet fruit, with no particular subtlety. Shows powerful tangerine, pineapple, apple and honey flavors.",,85,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Terra Sonoma

US,"Fairly dark and full-bodied for a rosé, but the wine is completely dry and crisp in acidity, and the cherry, orange rind and spice flavors are nicely grounded with minerals. A serious rosé that you can drink with steak or lamb chops.",Reichel Vineyard Rosé of,90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Respite
US,"Surprisingly thin for an Alexander Valley Cabernet, especially at this price. It's clean and proper, being dry and softly tannic, but the cherry and blackberry flavors taste watered down.",Five Sisters Blend,85,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Rickards
US,"A pleasant, light-bodied wine with a silky texture that could almost be a rosé. Give it a few minutes in the fridge to let it chill so the acids and tannins can properly frame the raspberry, cherry and spice flavors.",Organic,86,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Grenache,Horse & Plow
US,"Here's a strong, ripe Cabernet, made in a popular style meant to appeal to fans of fruity colas. It's oaky and slightly sweet in blackberry jam, although it's technically dry. Drink now.",,86,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Murphy-Goode

US,"Hot, dry and ripe, with strong flavors of grilled blackberries and cherries, red and black currants, tobacco, cocoa and peppery spices. Needs rich fare, like hard cheeses, olive oil, beef and lamb, to stand up to the tannins.",Old Vines Reserve,86,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mantra
US,"This Zinfandel is slightly sweet. Not too much, but there's a touch of sugar to the blackberries and cherries, which makes them jammy. The other flavors range from black pepper and anise to chocolate and cedar. Drink now with rich pasta and cheese dishes.",Sin Zin,86,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Oaky and dull, with flavors of sweetened pineapple juice that are heavily plastered with caramel and buttered popcorn. Needs greater restraint and subtlety.",Estate,84,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stuhlmuller Vineyards

US,"So young now, it's all primary fruit, oak and tannins. But It's a stunner. The fruit is enormous, packing explosive blackberry, black cherry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors, while oak brings an elaborate smoky sweetness. Feels dramatic and important, and should age well for ten years, at least.",Best Barrels,95,95,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Rock
US,"Fruit and spice star in this bone-dry Cabernet. It's very forward in blackberries, cherries, currants and dark chocolate, while the spice shows in the form of pepper, clove and star anise. The tannins are quite strong and rasping, and may never fully resolve. Give it 3–5 years in the cellar.",,88,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dashe Cellars

US,"Amazingly rich flavors mark this Cab, ranging from blackberries and black currants to earthier notes of herbs, cola and olive tapenade. It's dry, and the tannins are lush and easy. Super easy to drink, but could benefit from greater structure, as it's a bit too soft.",Reserve,87,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Dark, rich, tannic and elaborately detailed, this Cab, an inaugural release from the winery, shows dramatic weight and intensity of black currant fruit. It's also rich in smoky new oak. If size alone were everything, it would be a perfect wine. As it is, it overwhelms the palate with power, and it's hard to imagine what to pair with it at the table. Seems designed for the cellar, but it's a guess. Tasted twice.",Rockaway Single Vineyard,90,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong

US,"Good, but not without problems. It's dry and tannicly smooth in the mouth, with black cherry and mocha flavors. But there's a tart, sandpapery roughness that's just a little short of ripe. Drink now.",Stone Vineyard,86,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hawkes
US,"Grown at a high altitude above Alexander Valley, this Merlot shows dense, hard mountain tannins that lock it down in astringency. The question with such wines always is, will it age? In this case, despite a rich core of cherries and blackberries, it's doubtful. The wine is so unusually tough that the tannins seem likely to outlive the fruit.",Lost Pine,87,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Stonestreet
US,"The line between tart gooseberries and that strong ammonia smell is a thin one. This Sauvignon Blanc steps just over the edge.

US,"Tastes like ripeness ran away with this wine. The blackberry flavors are explosive, making it taste like jam, while the oak is very strong, almost overpowering in smoky char. Pretty good, but overworked. Drink soon.",Estate,88,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Rock

Good grapes went into the making of this wine, and good winemaking too. Drink now.",,88,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hobo
US,"The best Alexander Valley Chardonnays, such as this, show flamboyant tropical flavors. Capture's '09 shows ripe, extravagant pineapple, mango, papaya, nectarine and lime fruit, with a grilled quality baked into a pastry dessert. It's a big wine framed by fine acidity. The oak appliqué is just about perfect.",Ma Vie Carol,92,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Capture

US,"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",Redwood Ranch,85,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Field Stone
US,"This bottling has been a star for Simi since its inception, and the '05 is among their best ever. It shows Alexander Valley's softness and slight herbaceousness, along with decadently rich red currant, mocha and oak flavors.

This is a good price, especially compared to what's going on in Napa Valley.",Landslide Vineyard,94,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi

Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it holds subtle complexity.",Cyrus,92,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Too strong and extracted in blackberry and cherry fruit, almost like pure jam, a sweet, candied impression that the caramel of new oak compounds.

US,"The best Chardonnays from this warm Sonoma County valley show tropical fruit flavors and are quite decadent, and this is one of the best.

It's a lovely wine to drink now.",Wetzel Family Estate,88,21,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"There's something Alexander Valley-esque in the soft complexity of the tannins, and the slight herbaceousness that accompanies the black currants, cured tobacco and grilled meat. It's also a classic Petite Syrah, with that variety's inky black color and impenetrable tannins and dryness. This wine surely wants until 2020 in the cellar.",,89,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Denier-Handal

US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend has some Petite Sirah folded in, presumably for color and tannins. It's a big, sturdy wine, dry yetsomewhat soft, with complex black currant, blackberry jam, sweetened herb tea and sandalwood flavors. It's a little rustic, but fine to drink now, with everything from hamburgers and grilled steak to short ribs.",Devil's Inkstand,89,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Geyser Peak

The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Stuhlmuller Vineyard,87,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutcher Crossing
US,"When this hilly vineyard Cab first came out, it was very good, but quality has slipped over the years. The '04 is perfectly decent in oak-infused blackberry and currant flavors and rich tannins, and it may even improve for a few years.",Landslide Vineyard,87,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi

Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the Alexander Valley's soft tannins and herb-tinged flavors of blackberries and black cherries, topped with smoky sweet new oak. Easy to like now with a charred steak.",Countenance,89,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Farrier
US,"A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass. Shows a lightness and airy feeling that differentiates it from the heavier cult Napa style. Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving.",Scion,93,58,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Young

US,"Very rich and extracted, and much more full-bodied than Sausal's “Family” Zin, with which it was co-released. This is one to cellar for a few years, to let things come together.

US,"Almost a repeat of the ‘05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding.",Robert Young Vineyard,87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Iron Horse has one of the most consistent Viognier records in California, with a style all their own. From their mountain vineyard in Alexander Valley, the '06 shows tremendous balance, with an exciting tension between dry, minerally acidity and Viognier's exotic fruit and wildflower flavors. The wine was stainless-steel fermented and did not undergo malolactic fermentation, which helps account for the cleanliness.",T-T Vineyard,92,26,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Iron Horse
US,"A lovely, balanced, elegant young Cab. We're not in Napa Valley anymore, for the wine has a dried cherry herbaceousness and different tannin structure, but it defines the style that made Alexander Valley famous for Cabernet Sauvignon. For all those who complain that Cab isn't food-friendly, this one is. Ageability is almost guaranteed. Best now through 2014, with proper cellaring.",Walking Tree Vineyard,92,47,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak

US,"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages. It's a fine, dry, acidic Chardonnay whose oak-infused lemon and lime flavors will complement sourdough bread and cracked crab.",Belle Terre Vineyard,90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Just beautiful, showing Alexander Valley Zin at its best. Dry and full-bodied, it's enormously flavorful in spicy wild berries, with a cherry liqueur smoothness. But it's not high in alcohol, and is thoroughly balanced and elegant.",Family Estate Grown,92,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008.",,85,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano

US,"This is a good, full-bodied, dry Cabernet that delivers with plenty of varietal personality.

Easy to find, with 12,000 cases produced.",Landslide Vineyard,88,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
US,"This Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux blend is softly approachable now for its wealth of black and red cherry, currant and toasty oak flavors. It has rich tannins and a long, spicy finish. Should hold in the bottle and possibly gain momentum for 4–5 years.",Presshouse,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Farrier
US,"Give this lusty young Cabernet a few years to let the parts mellow. Right now, it's tannic and sharp, with black currant and blackberry jam flavors, and the oak hasn't been integrated with the fruit. 2011–2014.",,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"Made from 70% Sémillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc, this softly appealing wine has rich flavors of mangoes and guavas, with a cashew nut butteriness. It's smooth in the mouth, and a little honey sweet in the finish. A nice cocktail sipper.",Andiron,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Farrier
US,"A bit more direct than the '05, which must be due to the so-so vintage. The wine is soft and immediately appealing for its red berry pie filling, red currant, baking spice, green olive tapenade and oak flavors. Should develop for years in the bottle, without necessarily gaining additional complexity.",Red Winery Vineyard,87,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hawkes

US,"Tough and gritty in tannins, with currant fruit flavors veering into raisins and heavy-handed oak. Not likely to mellow with age.",Lazy S Vineyard,83,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Esterlina
US,"This has long been one of the best Sauvignon Blanc-Viognier blends in California, and the '06 continues that tradition. Coming from a cool vintage, it's very dry and racy, with a scour of acidity and stony, minerally flavors, with touches of citrus blossom and wildflower. No, it's not a fruit bomb, but it's a sleek, elegant wine, in the European tradition.",T-T Vineyard Cuvée R,90,26,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Iron Horse
US,"This is not an ageable Cab, but it is balanced and complex, and has more than $20 worth of elegance. Dry and softly tannic, the Provençal herb, black cherry and oak flavors make you reach for a second glass.",,90,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hobo
US,"Robert Young is one of Alexander Valley's greatest wineries. After others achieved success with their Merlot grapes, they started making their own wine, and consumers are the beneficiaries. Truly soft and voluptuous, yet richly structured, the wine is totally dry, with a dried herb edge to the cherry flavors. The complexity is enormous, but somehow the wine remains delicate and elegant.",,94,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Robert Young

US,"This is a great price for a blush wine of this quality and complexity. It's very dry, yet with a fruity sweetness of strawberries and cherries. Wonderfully fresh and clean in vibrant acids, it's hard to believe it was unoaked because it's so creamy.",Rosato di,87,12,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Iron Horse
US,"Sangiovese can make a great rosé for the same reasons it's tough to perfect as a red wine in California. The acidity works in its favor, making the cherry and spice flavors clean and bright. The wine did not undergo malolactic fermentation, never touched oak and is thoroughly dry.",T-T Vineyard Rosato di,89,13,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Iron Horse

US,"This is a crisp, clean wine, with ultraripe flavors of apricots, grapefruits, lemongrass and flowers. It is overtly sweet, though, which limits its appeal.",,83,14,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,DeLorimier
US,"DeLorimier's reds all have tasted sugary-sweet to me lately, which has got to be a conscious decision by management. It's baffling, because the estate fruit is good, and Alexander Valley is capable of producing superb reds that are fully dry. So what's going on?",,83,23,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,DeLorimier
US,"Robert Young's Scion has become the quintessential Alexander Valley Cab. The opposite of a big Napa Cab, it has a soft, gentle texture, with good cherry and anise flavors, and a rich gout de terroir earthiness.

US,"Young and jammy, this is a Cab that tastes like it just came out of the fermenter. It's all grapy, primary fruit blackberries and cherries, with an undertow of smoky vanilla.",,86,16,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mia's Playground
US,"Shows real classy Syrah character in the peppery, meaty aromas and flavors, and plenty of ripe, fruit and berry complexities. Also demonstrates the balance this winery is known for. Actually more of an old-style field blend, with other Rhône varieties.",,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Château Souverain
US,"After two years in French oak, the tannins are soft, but the acids still evident. Has pretty aromas and flavors of vanilla, tobacco, smoke and cassis, just seems a bit hard-edged on the finish.

US,"This is a dramatically structured Chardonnay, a finely balanced wine from Alexander Valley, which produces lush, exotic Chards. The warmth of the vintage has softened the acidity, and while it's not an ager, it's enormously complex. Papaya, mango, crystalized ginger candy and cinnamon spice flavors are long and deep, while extensive new oak adds luscious butterscotch and caramel notes.",Reserve,94,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stuhlmuller Vineyards

US,". If you're familiar with the lush, complex Chards from Robert Young, this will ring a bell. It's layered in ripe mango, guava, nectarine, peach and smoky, caramelized oak flavors, with an exotic taste of butter-sautéed bananas.

US,"The mouthfeel on this 100% Cabernet is tough in tannins, with an astringent, sandpapery feeling. Still, it's dry and balanced, with a rich vein of blackberries, black currants and herbs, accented with spicy, 50% new French oak.

US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated Bordeaux blend is the winery's top red, and in the warm vintage of 2004, they've produced a balanced, rich wine that needs time. It shows classic flavors of currants, chocolate, sweet tobacco, herbs and cedar, but the tannins are fresh and arch. Should develop gracefully over the next 10–12 years.",Cyrus,92,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards

US,"There are several things wrong here, although there's lots to like. On the plus side is lush, ripe blackberry, cherry and oak flavor. On the minus is a Porty smell and rustic, slightly green tannins that make the finish astringent.",Meolo Vineyards,84,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Vino Bello
US,"This is a reserve bottling of Goldschmidt's regular Vyborny bottling. It's essentially the same wine, but far more tannic, and perhaps a touch more concentrated. Dustily dry and astringent now, it seems like a guaranteed cellar candidate, with its rich core of blackberries, currants, mocha, herbs, anise and cedar. Better after 2011, and for many years.",Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt

US,"Compared to the winery's '02 Reserve Cab, this is less tannic, more accessible, due to the dominance of Merlot in the blend. Still, it's a tannic young wine, dry and astringent despite rich cherry and mocha flavors. It is not particularly drinkable now, and is not a longterm bet.

The wine is awesome, vast and complex, fascinating in every aspect, yet locked down in tough tannins that exaggerate the acidity, making the wine functionally undrinkable. It is a beautiful, classic Cabernet, very near perfect, and certainly one of the successes of the vintage. Don't even think of drinking it before 2014, and it should evolve in the bottle for a good 10 years after that.",Rockfall,99,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Pretty much as good as any Cabernet out there, if not better, and at a fraction of the price you'll pay for the “cults.” If there was ever a wine made for the cellar, it's this one, the antidote for those who consider California Cabernet a simple fruit bomb. Completely dry, with exquisite tannins, its blackberry, currant, red licorice and oak-inspired flavors are massive and classic. Hard to exaggerate how good this fine wine is. Drink 2013–2020 and beyond.",Black Cougar Ridge,97,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"A dramatic wine, authoritative in tannins, bone dry and noble. Withholds its best under a cloak of astringency, but already shows its mountain terroir in the complexity of its structure and deep, intense blackberry, currant, blueberry and dried herb flavors. Should develop bottle complexities for at least a decade and probably longer.",Monument Ridge,96,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Grown in a portion of the winery's considerable holdings in the high Mayacamas range, this Cabernet is ridiculously rich and flamboyant in black currant flavors, wrapped into the ripest, densest, sweetest tannins imaginable. Exceptionally vibrant, intense and compact, it will develop bottle complexity for a good 15 years.",Christopher's,96,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Made from 100% Cabernet grown in a hilly part of the valley, this wine is tight and dry in tannins. It's so astringent, it's nearly impossible to enjoy now. Yet it's extraordinarily rich and explosive in blackberry tart, black cherry pie and cassis flavors, and feels dramatic in the mouth. Should easily improve over the next decade. Hold until 2013.",Rockaway,94,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Fruity in blackberry and cherry flavors, this is easy to drink, with a good acid-tannin balance.",,84,9,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kirkland Signature
US,"Lots of jammy blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit in this dry Merlot. It's a little rough in the mouth, with pronounced acidity and some green flavors. Drink now.",,85,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Roth
US,"Full-throttle Chardonnay, creamy and opulent, showing lemon custard, orange honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp, zesty acidity. Exceptionally rich and balanced, it's a beautiful wine for pairing with shellfish entrées.",Gravel Bench,93,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"This is a softly tannic, dense, extracted and acidic wine that floods the mouth with the sharp tastes of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. It's good, in a rustic way. Drink now.",Estate Bottled,84,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,La Storia
US,"So rich, deeply flavored and heady, it's almost like a dessert Port, although it's dry, not sweet. The blackberry and cherry flavors taste like they were baked into cookies. As you'd expect from a Petite Sirah, the tannins are thick, but nothing you can't drink now with barbecue.",La Storia,88,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Trentadue
US,"This nearly 100% Cabernet is strongly flavored, bone dry, very tannic and nowhere near ready. It has a tough, astringent mouthfeel, and the concentrated richness of grapes grown on low-yielding hillsides. Intense flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, cola and herbs mark this fine, ageable wine. Don't touch it before 2013, and it should ride out many years beyond that.",Brothers Ridge,93,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"With a streak stream of acidity and medicinal cherry flavors, this Merlot has a Life Saver-candy taste, with a sweet finish.",Estate Block 500,83,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Trentadue
US,"This is an everyday Cabernet, dry, tannic and somewhat green, with tobacco and cherry flavors. It lacks generosity, which no amount of decanting or aging will help.",,84,29,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Roth
US,"This shows classic Cabernet Sauvignon character, and there's even a Bordeaux-like earthiness that grounds the cherry, currant and cedar flavors. Made from fruit grown in the winery's Alexander Valley vineyard, this is ideal for drinking now.",Block Collection Walking Tree,90,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"Classic Petite Sirah from a warm climate, inky black, soft in texture and explosively rich in tannins. Extravagant in the essence of ripe summer blackberries and cassis, with a meaty quality surrounded by plenty of sweet, charred oak. Drink this robust beauty now with beef stews, barbecued spareribs, or even dark chocolate.",Big River Ranch,92,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Bella
US,"A big, voluptuous Cabernet, brimming with ripe blackberries, plums, mocha, cedar, and a chewy, tangy meaty taste, like beef jerky. Solid, soft and easy to drink.",,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Windsor Sonoma
US,"A brisk, fruity Sauvignon Blanc that flatters with rich flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and papayas. There's a honeyed sweetness, but it's basically dry. Easy to drink as a cocktail sipper.",,87,14,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Roth
US,"Dry, racy and elegant, a food-friendly Chardonnay to pair with shellfish in cream sauce, salmon, or a fine roasted chicken. Clean, vibrant acidity highlights citrus, white peach and nectarine flavors, with a rich coating of smoky oak. Drink now through 2015.",Broken Road,92,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"Smells sharp and jammy and tastes tart and acidic, with jellied cherry flavors leading to a sugary finish.",Fióre Marcheschi,81,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Irish Monkey Cellars
US,"Off-dry to sweetish, this has honey, orange, apricot, lime and vanilla flavors. It shows Sauvignon's clean, brisk acidity, but that taste of sweetness limits its appeal.",,84,17,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Roth
US,"This dessert wine is very sweet but not incredibly so, with a flavor like apricot and tangerine jam, drizzled with honey and vanilla extract and sprinkled with cinnamon. If that sounds delicious, it is, and the acidity makes it clean and zesty. The price isn't bad, considering that this is a full bottle, not a half bottle as so many dessert wines are.",Patrona,91,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Muscat Canelli,Stephen & Walker
US,"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated.",,89,13,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"Barely acceptable. Dry, harsh and vegetal.",Discovery,80,11,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Q
US,"Tightly wound and sleek, a nervous, elegant young wine that needs time in the cellar or decanting to begin to open up. The lemon, lime, honeysuckle and buttered toast flavors have a distinctive tang of minerals, which makes the finish bracing. Now through 2015.",Upper Barn,91,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"Dramatically rich and full-bodied in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. With thick, fine tannins giving it a youthful astringency, this Bordeaux blend needs to be cellared. Should develop bottle notes over the next ten years.",Legacy,91,85,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Stonestreet
US,"Soft and rather one-dimensional, this Cabernet shows ripe cherry, raspberry, blackberry and oak flavors. It's bone dry, showing herbal, astringent tannins. Could develop interestingly in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.",Clone 337 Bevill-Mazzocco Vineyard,86,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Suncé Vineyard & Winery
US,"This is immediately attractive in blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with a subtle coating of smoky oak. With plenty of elegance, it's wonderful for drinking now. It should be relatively easy to find, with nearly 20,000 cases in circulation.",,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Folie à Deux
US,"There's a very good wine in this bottle that wants to come out, but right now, it's locked down in youthfully dry, herbal tannins. It's a very rich, finely grown wine, showing the ripeness of the vintage in its blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 5–8 years.",Redgrav Vineyard,91,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"With the creamy, yeasty notes of lees stirring and fine, smoky oak nuances, this soft, buttery Chardonnay is rich in lemon, lime and white peach flavors. It's an upscale sipper that will develop bottle nuances over the next six years.",Bear Point,90,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"This is one of the best Alexander Valley Cabs of the vintage. It shows tightly controlled tannins framing luxurious black cherry, currant, dark chocolate and oak flavors that are dramatically rich and balanced. So delicious now, it's hard to keep from popping the cork, but it should develop in the bottle over the next eight years.",Single Vineyard Selection Yoeman Vineyard,94,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years, an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent, the parts haven't yet come together. It's massive in blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors, and the tannins are pure Alexander Valley—soft and herbal—but the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Put it in the cellar until at least 2018, and it could go far beyond that.",Plus Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard,94,150,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"Made from two old-vine vineyards, this Zin is soft, high in alcohol, sweet in glycerine and fabulously rich in berry, chocolate, currant, licorice and dusty spice flavors. There's nothing quite like it in the world. Drink it now with lusty barbecue or, for something different, Szechuan beef.",Two Patch,90,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"For twenty bucks or less, you get a Cabernet that's lush, soft and rich. The fruity flavors of freshly crushed, ripe raspberries and cherries are accented by hints of smoky oak in this gently tannic wine.",Crazy Creek Vineyard,90,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Katherine Goldschmidt
US,"Drink this polished Cabernet now to appreciate its blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors. The tannins are astringent, but it shows elegance. It doesn't seem to be a wine for the cellar.",,87,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cinnabar
US,"A little rugged around the edges, with some uneven tannins, but it's drily elegant, and offers a wealth of blackberry, black currant, cola, anise and herb flavors, accented elegantly with smoky oak. Should develop in the bottle over the next 3–5 years.",Baby Blue,87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Rock
US,"This very dry Syrah has soft tannins and a full-bodied mouthfeel, with complicated flavors of baked cherries, cola, bacon and sandalwood. It's quite a good wine, but astringent now, making for a puckery feeling. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with rich fare.",,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Blue Rock
US,"This Zinfandel specialist tries its hand at Cabernet, with excellent results. With modest alcohol, the wine is thoroughly ripe, showing complex flavors of blackberries, crème de cassis, herbs and cedar. It will be fascinating to watch this Bordeaux-style wine develop over the years.",,92,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hobo
US,"This flashy Cabernet is one of Coppola's best Sonoma County Cabernets ever, a fine followup to the great 2007. It immediately impresses with richness, smoothness of texture and complexity, offering waves of ripe summer blackberry, blueberry and smoke. The tannins are firm, dusty and soft, making the wine drinkable now and over the next six years with steak.",Archimedes,92,52,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Unoaked, with pineapple, vanilla and spice flavors and some sweet cream from sur lie aging. But loses points for some green pyrazine smells and tastes.",,83,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Merriam
US,"Young, dense, tannic and oaky, a tough wine that resists the palate. There's a core of blackberry and currant fruit, and things may resolve themselves over the years. Yet it doesn't seem to have the integrity of Stonestreet's other '07s.",Monolith,88,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"This has been a very successful second label from Goldschmidt, and with this 2009, they again hit gold. The wine is smoothly tannic and dry in black cherry- pie and red currant flavors, with all kinds of interesting herb, carob bean, spice and oak complications. It's elegant and complex to drink now and over the next 5–6 years.",Lone Tree Vineyard,92,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forefathers
US,"This bone-dry Cabernet is made in a leaner style, bearing flavors of sour cherry candy, cocoa and red currant, with the smoky spiciness from oak barrel aging. It's also quite acidic. This needs a big, rich cut of meat to balance it out.",Redgrav Vineyard,90,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"This is really one of the best values in Cabernet- on the market. It's so deliciously rich in blackberry, currant and chocolate, you'll want to drink the whole bottle right now. Kudos to winemaker Nick Goldschmidt for producing a wine this good at such a good price.",Crazy Creek,91,21,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Katherine Goldschmidt
US,"Heavy and sweet, with a sugared vanilla edge to the red cherry flavors.",Merlot,82,12,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Mer Blanc
US,"Super-fruity, offering a blast of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, persimmons, red plums and bacon, finished with enormous spices. The wine is technically dry but tastes sweet with high-alcohol glycerine and smoky oak. Drink this strong, uni-dimensional Zinfandel now.",Stone,85,29,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"A difficult vintage for the winery, and not the most successful Robert Young Chardonnay. But it does show the elegance of the vineyard. Rich in acids and oak, its underlying flavors are of oranges and pineapples. Drink now, not too cold.",,88,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Young
US,"A little extra time in the bottle has yielded a softly attractive Cabernet filled with lush flavors. It has complex tiers of raspberries, cherries and tobacco, with gentle tannins and a light, spicy touch of sandalwood. Pretty and polished now.",Limited Production,89,29,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Magistrate
US,"A bit quick on the finish, but otherwise a nice everyday Chardonnay. Shows a soft, buttercream texture, with dry, subtle flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.",,85,13,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Geyser Peak
US,"It's unheard of for a winery to hold back a Sangiovese for more than four years before releasing it, but DeLorimier did. It's done the wine well, allowing it to soften and mellow. It's still quite acidic, and a little rustic as California Sangiovese tends to be, but there's a lot of deliciousness. Try as an interesting alternative to Pinot Noir.",,87,29,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,DeLorimier
US,"This dry, soft wine has slightly herbal flavors of sage that ground the ripe blackberries and cherries. It's a pleasant wine, although it's rather rustic and calls for everyday fare.",Diamond Dust Vineyard,84,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Trig Point
US,"Made in the simple modern style of lots of caramelized oak and sweet fruit, with no particular subtlety. Shows powerful tangerine, pineapple, apple and honey flavors.",,85,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Terra Sonoma
US,"Shows the wonderfully soft, ripe, dusty tannins of Alexander Valley, as well as pure, ripe blackberry, black cherry, cassis and smoky oak flavors that are frankly delicious. The finish, however, is overly sweet, which likely will limit ageability.",Scion,87,58,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Young
US,"At four-plus years, this is a harsh wine, tough in tannins and over-oaked. You'll find blackberry, cherry, currant and herb flavors and a dry, hard finish. Okay for everyday fare, but pricey for what you get.",All In Claret,84,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Murphy-Goode
US,"A lovely Bordeaux blend, fruity and incredibly rich. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the Alexander Valley's soft tannins and herb-tinged flavors of blackberries and black cherries, topped with smoky sweet new oak. Easy to like now with a charred steak.",Countenance,89,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Farrier
US,"Oaky and tannic, marked by caramel flavors that dominate the blackberries, black currants, cherries and chocolate. Feels heavy now, but improves in the glass. Decant, or try holding for a few years to see what happens.",Geyserville Ranch,82,48,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Trione

US,"Nicely dry and crisp in acidity, with good varietal flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits, green grass and white pepper. There's also a lot of feline emission, so if you're sensitive to that, you won't like it.",Redwood Ranch Vineyard Select,86,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Field Stone
US,"An unfortunate wine. It may have been better a few years ago, but the fruit is fading, leaving behind a taste of vegetables and mint. Doesn't seem likely to reverse course.",Murphy Ranch Sarah Block,82,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Murphy-Goode
US,"Give a good shot of air in a decanter to this Syrah before you pour it. Fresh out of the bottle, it's all candied cherry and black raspberry fruit. Oxygen will help soften it and bring out earthy, herbal complexities.",Estate,86,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Currants, black and red, are the dominant flavors of this drily elegant wine. You'll also find notes of briary blackberries and dark, unsweetened baker's chocolate. Best in the next few years before it loses fruity freshness.",,87,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lake Sonoma
US,"A good, somewhat rustic Merlot, with cherry liqueur, sweet tobacco and white pepper flavors. Drink this pleasant wine now with a nice roast chicken.",Estate,85,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"A good Cabernet, if a little gritty, with herb-infused flavors of black currants, plums and spices. Might soften with a few years in the bottle, but not really a longterm ager.",Director's Cut,86,29,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Francis Ford Coppola

US,"This is a good, full-bodied, dry Cabernet that delivers with plenty of varietal personality.

Easy to find, with 12,000 cases produced.",Landslide Vineyard,88,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
US,"This Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux blend is softly approachable now for its wealth of black and red cherry, currant and toasty oak flavors. It has rich tannins and a long, spicy finish. Should hold in the bottle and possibly gain momentum for 4–5 years.",Presshouse,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Farrier
US,"A bit on the extracted, heavy side, with jammy blackberry and currant flavors, but give it the right food and it can shine. Suggests beef or chicken barbecue heavily slathered in a sweet sauce. Sangiovese, Bordeaux reds and Montepulciano.",La Storia Cuvée 32,86,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Trentadue
US,"Tannic and hot, this Zin is massive in blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, licorice and spice flavors. High alcohol gives a burn to the mouthfeel that barbecue sauce, slathered onto chicken and beef, will help soften.",,85,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,La Storia
US,"Give this lusty young Cabernet a few years to let the parts mellow. Right now, it's tannic and sharp, with black currant and blackberry jam flavors, and the oak hasn't been integrated with the fruit. 2011–2014.",,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"Made from 70% Sémillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc, this softly appealing wine has rich flavors of mangoes and guavas, with a cashew nut butteriness. It's smooth in the mouth, and a little honey sweet in the finish. A nice cocktail sipper.",Andiron,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Farrier
US,"A bit more direct than the '05, which must be due to the so-so vintage. The wine is soft and immediately appealing for its red berry pie filling, red currant, baking spice, green olive tapenade and oak flavors. Should develop for years in the bottle, without necessarily gaining additional complexity.",Red Winery Vineyard,87,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hawkes
US,"Tastes simple and fruity-sweet and over-worked, with ripe, jammy black cherry fruit flavors and lots of sweet, caramelized oak. Will appeal to fans of this easy style.",Mosaic,85,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,DeLorimier

US,"This is a big, tannic and dry Cabernet, but it's very elegant, and shows the pedigree of Alexander Valley at its best. Impeccably balanced in acidity and tannins, the fruit is pure blackberries and black currants, with a wonderful earthiness suggesting dried sage and thyme. Should develop nicely over the next 6–8 years.",Reserve,91,47,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"A lovely Cabernet that shows the soft tannins and earthy herbaceousness of Alexander Valley. On a fruitier note are the cherries and red currants that are accented by sweet, smoky oak. Spicy and dry, this polished wine wants a few years in the cellar. 2011–2015.",Reichel Vineyard,91,48,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Respite
US,"Despite some richly extracted blackberry and black currant flavors, this wine's tannins and acids are out of whack.

US,"Mainly Sauvignon Blanc, with 18% Sémillon, this is a very fruity young wine. It brims with Meyer lemon, pineapple, pear, peach, apricot and lime flavors, but is rescued from being a fruit bomb by crisp acidity and a nice minerality. There's just a touch of sweet oak for richness.",Hay Hook,87,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,Farrier

US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated Bordeaux blend is the winery's top red, and in the warm vintage of 2004, they've produced a balanced, rich wine that needs time. It shows classic flavors of currants, chocolate, sweet tobacco, herbs and cedar, but the tannins are fresh and arch. Should develop gracefully over the next 10–12 years.",Cyrus,92,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"A beautiful Cabernet, this is soft, dry and delicious. It really showcases the Alexander Valley in its classic profile of herb-infused blackberry fruit and gentle tannins.",Diamond Dust Vineyard,90,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trig Point
US,"A tough, green wine, with minty sharp acidity and not much fruit, although you'll find some modest cherry flavor.",,82,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Praxis
US,"Very rich, extracted and soft in tannins and acids, a melt-in-your-mouth Zin with almost sweet flavors of milk chocolate, crushed ripe cherries, licorice, caramelized wood and oodles of black pepper. Should develop over the next 4–6 years.",Century Vines Estate Grown,88,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"A solid Cabernet, with earthy flavors of blackberries, tobacco, sweet dried herbs and smoke. Ready now with a juicy steak.",Mavericks Signature Series Special Blend,88,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"Hard mountain tannins characterize this Cab, which was grown above 2,000 feet in the Mayacamas. It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring. Best 2012–2018.",Christopher's,96,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",,96,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy
US,"This Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a good everyday wine. It's full-bodied and smooth, with flavors of blackberry, currant and dried herb.",Crazy Creek Estate,86,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Fidelity
US,"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",,93,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forefathers
US,"Aged for more than two years in new oak, this 100% Cab bursts with smoky vanilla and char that currently dominate its underlying fruit. But it's likely that time in the bottle will meld everything together. The powerful black currant, black cherry, carob and tobacco flavors, wrapped into rich, soft tannins, suggest holding at least through 2008, and the wine should develop well for a decade.",Winemaker's Reserve,92,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Souverain
US,"Soft and still fairly tannic at the age of four–plus, with the herbal taste that often marks Alexander Valley Cabs. Yet there's enough blackberry, currant and cocoa richness to satisfy. Should develop over the next six years.",Estate Grown,87,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sausal
US,"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.",Vyborny Vineyard,95,70,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"While this Sauvignon Blanc seems to have some sweetness, it also has crisp acidity and pleasing minerality that gives the citrus and tropical fruit flavors a tang. It would pair nice with Vietnamese noodle dishes or chicken tacos.",,86,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Greedy
US,"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6–8 years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.",Redwood Ranch,93,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Joseph Jewell
US,"Beautifully soft and limpid. So pretty and polished now, with ultrafine tannins framing ripe, dry flavors of black and red cherries, currants, chocolate, herbs and smoky sandalwood. Dramatic and opulent, this 100% Cab was aged in 40% new French oak.",Highlands Estates Raptor Peak,93,80,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson

US,"Big, tough, gutsy, fruity, tannic. In other words, Petite Sirah, and classic at that.

Good now, and should develop over a decade.",Staten Family Reserve,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Field Stone
US,"Always an interesting wine, and one that's made to drink with food. Dry and balanced, it shows flavors of blackberries, herbs and oak, with a soft, velvety mouthfeel.

US,"Better known as a Zinfandel house, Sausal can sometimes surprise with their richly soft, intricately layered Cabs, and the '04 is just that. It's immediately likeable for the wealth of blackberries, chocolate, cedar and spice. Best now and soon.",Estate Grown,90,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sausal

US,"Here's a polished young Merlot that's sophisticated enough to accompany a fine meal, yet doesn't selfishly demand all the attention to itself. It's very dry, smoothly tannic and crisp, with herb-infused blackberry and cherry flavors. Will take some age, and should be terrific with roast pork.",,90,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sebastiani
US,"Made in the drier, leaner, earthier and more Chablisian style that's increasingly popular, this Chardonnay is a natural for food pairings, such as shellfish. It's a minerally wine, with elegant citrus, kiwi and pear flavors and a streamlined complexity.",Estate,91,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"This is a big, dramatically tannic Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's full-bodied, mouth-filling power, as well as blackberry, coffee, beef jerky and sandalwood flavors that finish rich and long. Should live for many years, gradually softening and sweetening.",Todd Brothers Ranch,90,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Dashe Cellars
US,"For those looking for a leaner, earthier but still-stylish Cabernet, this is the ticket. It's very dry, with soft Alexander Valley tannins and flavors of blackberries, cherries and herbs. This elegant young wine could easily develop fascinating bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.",Estate,90,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stuhlmuller Vineyards

US,"Fairly dark and full-bodied for a rosé, but the wine is completely dry and crisp in acidity, and the cherry, orange rind and spice flavors are nicely grounded with minerals. A serious rosé that you can drink with steak or lamb chops.",Reichel Vineyard Rosé of,90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Respite

It doesn't seem like an ager, but it's an elegantly smooth wine to drink now.",,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Icaria
US,"Showing the intensely concentrated flavors of low-yielding old vines, this Zin is dense and rich in wild blackberry, briary blueberry, black pepper and cola flavors, with curious tastes that must come from the minerals in the earth. It's a bit rustic, but who cares? Break out your best grilled meats and poultry and savor this wine, if you can find it. Production was only 320 cases.",Old Vine 1908 Brignoli Vineyard,90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,J. Rickards
US,"Drew used to release this bottling some 16 or 17 months after the vintage. This wine has been rushed to market at barely more than a year of age. As a result, this young wine shows the ripe flavors and structural integrity of earlier vintages, such as the wonderful 2007, but it's rude in jam and acids. If you buy it, do what the winery should have: store it for at least an additional year, and better yet, three.",Fog-Eater,90,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Drew

US,"Soft and simple, with cherry-mocha flavors. Palls after a sip or two.",East Soda Rock Vineyard,82,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Charles Creek
US,"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages. It's a fine, dry, acidic Chardonnay whose oak-infused lemon and lime flavors will complement sourdough bread and cracked crab.",Belle Terre Vineyard,90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean

US,"This is a softly sophisticated Cabernet that will please fans of the variety who want a wine that's a little earthier than your riper Napa Valley versions. It has herb and tobacco flavors, but there's also a delicious sunburst of sweetly ripe cherries right in the middle that lasts through the finish. Should develop over the next 7–8 years.",Five Sisters Blend,89,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Rickards

US,"Slightly sweet, with simple apple and mango juice flavors and a veneer of oak-like vanillins and caramel. Crisp acidity helps to make the finish clean.",,82,17,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Souverain
US,"What a nice Zin. Shows all the Dry Creek character you could ask for, with briary, brambly flavors of wild forest berries, peppery spices and chocolate-covered mints. Savory and delicious, a fine wine to drink now with barbecue. Alcohol is very high, but somehow the wine doesn't taste hot.",Stone Ranch,89,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,DeLorimier
US,"Soft and gentle and fruity-sweet, this easy-drinking Zin has upfront flavors of pie-filling cherries and raspberries, sprinkled with cocoa, cinnamon, pepper and vanilla. Delicious now; production was only 511 cases.",Todd Brothers Ranch Old Vines,89,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"Impresses for the sheer power of ripeness, but also and especially for the structure. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa, herbs and sweetly smoked oak are beautiful and complex, yet the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. This single-vineyard wine is one of the finest Sonoma County Cabernets of the vintage. Should age effortlessly through 2014, growing purer and more elegant.",Rockaway,96,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"This is quite a sweet wine, rich and heady in chocolate, blackberry and blueberry jam and caramel flavors. It could be more concentrated, as it's a little thin. The variety is Petite Sirah.",Staten Family Reserve Vintage,86,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Port,Field Stone
US,"Showing the typical character of old vine Alexander Valley Zin, this bottling is rich and powerful in black currant, mocha, gingerbread, anise and vanilla spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It has a honeyed finish of cassis liqueur, and is best in its lusty youth.",Todd Brothers Vineyard,87,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"A noble red wine, based on the finely ground tannins and superb integration of fruit and oak. There's a purity to the complex waves of blackberries, currants, Canadian bacon, dried herbs, black pepper and sandalwood, with a minerally tang that must come from the soil. Wonderful now, this great Syrah should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years.",Van Ness Vineyard,94,53,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Palmeri
US,"This Bordeaux-style blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is the winery's best in years. It shows the soft tannins and herbal quality of Alexander Valley Cabs, yet is rich enough in blackberry, currant and oak to satisfy.

US,"Made from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah grown in the winery's estate vineyard, this is a fabulous wine. It's high in alcohol and a little hot, but superbly ripe, offering rich waves of raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant, licorice and mocha, with a sweet-smoke oak flavor. It's delicious and heady on its own, but try it with short ribs, pizza or duck breast with a cherry sauce.",San Lorenzo Estate,93,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Seghesio

With soft acidity and tannins, the fruit and oak star, offering lush flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate, plums, herbs and violets. Drink now. Kosher.",Special Reserve,92,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
US,"If you buy this 100% Cab, don't even think of drinking it now. Put it in the cellar and be patient. It has the soft tannins and herbal quality of a fine Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but it's just not ready to drink now. Give it until 2012, at least, to let the cherries, cocoa and red currants transmogrify to sweet mellowness.",Lone Tree Vineyard,93,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forefathers
US,"This is the winery's top Cabernet. The '09 is very ripe, rich and forward, offering powerful blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's quite good, but it needs a couple of years in the bottle. Best around 2015.",Alexander's Crown,92,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Fruit and spice star in this bone-dry Cabernet. It's very forward in blackberries, cherries, currants and dark chocolate, while the spice shows in the form of pepper, clove and star anise. The tannins are quite strong and rasping, and may never fully resolve. Give it 3–5 years in the cellar.",,88,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dashe Cellars
US,"Dry and smoothly tannic, the blackberry flavors have a softly herbal, earthy tinge. There's a lot of new oak, possibly too much, because the smoky caramel is just a bit overpowering.",Bob's Burn Pile,88,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Young
US,"This is dry, rich, heady, spicy and utterly delicious. As usual, it contains a splash of Petite Sirah. Already throwing some sediment, it's pretty tannic, with complex flavors of wild blackberry and blueberry, black currant, licorice, cola, bacon and plum sauce, with a hint of exotic pepper and spice. This great Zinfandel is a joy to drink.",Big River Ranch,92,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"A good wine for its classic structure and deep, complex black currant and cocoa flavors. But it's pretty oaky and tannic, giving it a hard, resistant feeling despite being nearly four years in age. Could surprise with up to 6 years in the cellar.",,87,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Adobe Road
US,"Full bodied and rich, as you'd expect a Petite Sirah rosé would be, this has cherry and sweet toast flavors, with a certain elegance. The winemaker suggests pairing this with sausages.",Heritage Block Rosé of,86,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Field Stone
US,"A very pleasant wine for drinking now. It shows cherry, blueberry, blackberry and mocha flavors, wrapped into finely ground, soft tannins, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The blend is a Bordeaux-style, with some Syrah.",Baby Blue,87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Blue Rock

US,"This is almost undrinkable now, despite its fantastically rich blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors. The tannins are substantial, and the acidity sticks out like a squirt of lime juice. All of its elements are good, but it needs time—as much as a decade and possibly longer.",Estate,90,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lancaster
US,"Grown at a high altitude above Alexander Valley, this Merlot shows dense, hard mountain tannins that lock it down in astringency. The question with such wines always is, will it age? In this case, despite a rich core of cherries and blackberries, it's doubtful. The wine is so unusually tough that the tannins seem likely to outlive the fruit.",Lost Pine,87,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Stonestreet
US,"Long one of America's top restaurant Cabs, Jordan's 2004 will admirably fulfill expectations. Ample cassis fruit is framed by soft tannins that promise immediate drinkability. Production was 60,000 cases.",,86,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jordan

US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, grown further north than the winery's amazing Rockaway bottling, which is to say in a hotter area. Comparisons are inevitable. Although it's rich and even dramatic, it's not as impressive a wine, showing a raisiny edge to the black currants and chocolate. Doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink now with upscale beef and lamb dishes.",Brothers Ridge Single Vineyard,88,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong

US,"Balance and complexity are the hallmarks of this Cab from veteran producer Hanna. It's deep and long in spicy, oaky blackberry and cherry fruit, while the structure is defined by soft tannins and good acids. Delicious now, and should hold for a decade.",,90,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"A bit tough and chewy, with jagged tannins, and the oak feels like it was imposed upon the wine. The black cherry, currant and chocolate flavors are pleasant enough. Ready now.",,86,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano
US,"A blend of Cab and Syrah grown on one of the winery's mountain vineyards, this first-rate wine demands time in the cellar. Bone dry, it shows dramatic layers of blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate, herbs and spices, wrapped in a firmly tannic, complex structure. Has that inimitable feeling of importance, but it would be a shame to pop the cork before late in 2008. Should come into its own 2009–2012.",Prevail West Face,93,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano

US,"An extremely nice wine, rich and balanced, that approximates Cabs costing far more. The flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate have an earthy edge of dried herbs and crushed spices, enhanced with smoky oak. Easy to find with 35,400 cases produced.",,89,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Souverain
US,"Dryness and herba notes mark this wine. Despite some rich oak influences, it comes down on the mineral and sage side, only vaguely suggesting fruitier notes of pineapples and peaches.",Stuhlmuller Vineyards Reserve,86,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Summers
US,"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.",Prevail Back Forty,93,85,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano

US,"From 130-year-old vines, this is a densely layered, bigtime Zin. The flavor concentration is just tremendous, a critical mass of briary, wild blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, licorice and fabulous Asian spice. True, the alcohol is on the high side, but the wine finishes balanced and dry. Will take up to 10 years of cellaring.",Century Vines,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"Here's a reserve that really does merit its special designation. Made from 90-year-old vines that likely contain varieties other than Zinfandel, the wine is rich and complex. Delivers all the wild, brambly Zin quality you want, with tiers of blackberries, cherries, cassis, cherry liqueur, tobacco, vanilla and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. This is an exceptionally well-balanced Zin that's best in its flashy youth.",Private Reserve,91,23,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"With flavors of wild blackberry and cherry, pepper, cinnamon, currant and heady cassis, this is a classic example of warm-climate Zin. It's high in alcohol and a little soft, but it is delicious. Serve it at a barbeque with burgers, ribs, chops, chicken and sausages.",Big River,88,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"Light in body, with a tobaccoey, dried herb quality to the cherry fruit. Finishes fast, but quite an elegant wine, and should age for a while.",,87,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jordan
US,"The winemakers call this their Pauillac-style wine, meaning that its character is marked by Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a brilliant wine, vastly deep, imposing and elegant, with a potent mountain flavor of black currant. The estate vineyard is very high in the Mayacamas Mountains, and you can sense the small size of the berries in the wines intensity, the sheer concentration, as well as the tannins—which are hard and tight. Clearly this is a wine that requires time in the cellar. Try in 2018, but it could worth aging well beyond that.",Révélation,95,135,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Capture
US,"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",Redwood Ranch,85,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Field Stone
US,"Oaky and dull, with flavors of sweetened pineapple juice that are heavily plastered with caramel and buttered popcorn. Needs greater restraint and subtlety.",Estate,84,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"Wattle Creek has done a good job with Cabernet over the years, and here's another one. I don't think '04 was their best vintage, as the wine is a little raisiny, despite an official alcohol of only 14.1%. But it shows a classy structure, polished dryness and a good depth of varietal black currant fruit, accented with new oak. Probably best now and for a few years.",,87,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wattle Creek
US,"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009.",,87,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arbios
US,"A very fine example of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, showing the elegance and complexity wines from that Sonoma County region can attain. Soft and intricate in tannins, the wine shows a mélange of blackberry, currant, cherry, sweet dried herb and smoky flavors that are delicious now, and should hold well for several years.",,92,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Family
US,"The line between tart gooseberries and that strong ammonia smell is a thin one. This Sauvignon Blanc steps just over the edge. The price is fine, and the wine is dry and crisp in citrus fruit flavors, but it is a little too green.",,84,14,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Souverain
US,"Soft, juicy and uncomplicated, this Cab Franc immediately offers likeable cherry and sweet oak flavors. The tannins beg for steak.",,87,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"The winery seems to be calling this Shiraz, not Syrah, because of the wine's direct simplicity, in the Aussie style. It's a soft, fruity wine, bigtime in cherries and blackberries, made to be immediately drinkable.",,86,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Shiraz,Wattle Creek
US,"A sharp, grainy Cabernet, with green tannins and a resulting hard cut of acids. Shows just enough blackberry, cherry and currant fruit, softened with sweetly smoked oak, to earn its score.",,84,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Angeline

US,"There's a good wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to taste it. The flavors of caramel and butterscotch swamp the underlying pineapples. Oakophiles will love it.",Island Block,84,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Murphy-Goode

US,"The best Alexander Valley Chardonnays, such as this, show flamboyant tropical flavors. Capture's '09 shows ripe, extravagant pineapple, mango, papaya, nectarine and lime fruit, with a grilled quality baked into a pastry dessert. It's a big wine framed by fine acidity. The oak appliqué is just about perfect.",Ma Vie Carol,92,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Capture

US,"The Cabernet Sauvignon really sticks out, with its cassis flavors and big, tough tannins. Meanwhile, new oak adds lush layers of smoke, woodspice and buttered toast. The result is a tough young wine that needs time, and possibly lots. Don't think of opening it before 2011, and it should develop for many more years. Potentially great.",Black Cougar Ridge,95,90,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Grown in the flatlands and benches of Alexander Valley, this Cab tastes more like a high mountain wine, with its firm tannins and flavor intensity. It's quite fine, showing intense blackberry, cherry, black currant, plum, cocoa and violet flavors that are tinged with soft, dry herbs. Very beautiful now for sheer charm, it will develop bottle complexities over the next decade. The best Cabernet from Hanna in memory.",Reserve,95,52,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"A really nice Merlot, and look at that price. It's dry, elegant and entirely balanced, with a rich earthy texture. Shows classic flavors of black cherries, black currants, violets, anise and sweet sandalwood. Terrific value.",Block 500,90,14,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Trentadue
US,"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Stuhlmuller Vineyard,87,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutcher Crossing
US,"When this hilly vineyard Cab first came out, it was very good, but quality has slipped over the years. The '04 is perfectly decent in oak-infused blackberry and currant flavors and rich tannins, and it may even improve for a few years.",Landslide Vineyard,87,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
US,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is very fine, but young. It needs time to allow the aggressive tannins to resolve and for the blackberry, black currant and herb flavors to emerge. New oak adds a sweet smokiness that will become an integral part of the final wine.",,94,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy
US,"A beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. May be a little lighter in body than some, but trades richness for elegance and impeccable structure. So pretty and polished, with entirely satisfying blackberry, spice and cedar flavors. A great accomplishment at a production of 42,000 cases.",,90,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"This is a reserve bottling of Goldschmidt's regular Vyborny bottling. It's essentially the same wine, but far more tannic, and perhaps a touch more concentrated. Dustily dry and astringent now, it seems like a guaranteed cellar candidate, with its rich core of blackberries, currants, mocha, herbs, anise and cedar. Better after 2011, and for many years.",Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt

US,"Not ready for drinking now. Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now. Seems like it will make a very fine bottle after 2011 or so.",Christopher's,93,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Has aromas of buttered toast and peaches a nd cream, but once it the mouth, it turns kind of harsh, with lemon skin and puckery acidity. There's a lot of new oak, which is nice, but it's out of balance with the underlying thinness of the fruit.",,83,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Not a success, with sweet-and-sour flavors. There's a vinegary edge to the sugared pineapples and tangerines.",,81,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Souverain
US,"Lancaster burst on the scene with enormous buzz, perhaps before they had really earned it. Steadily but surely, they've built up the wine, and the '04 is the best ever. It's a gorgeous Cab, softly complex, rich in cassis, cherry, spice and oak flavors anchored with warm, earthy tannins. In fact, the earthiness stands it in good contrast to Napa Valley, making it wholesome and complete.",,97,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lancaster

US,"Geyser Peak's Reserve Chards have been pretty good lately, as they learn how to bring balance to grapes that ripen so easily. The '05 is plenty ripe, packed with jammy apricot, tangerine and oaky vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's a rich, exotic wine, with good enough acidity for balance.",Reserve,88,23,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Geyser Peak
US,"This wine is so loaded with glycerine, it actually pours slow from the bottle, like honey. With 17.4 grams of residual sugar, it's decadently, deliriously sweet, but sugar is not its only charm. There's a fabulous flood of apricots, pineapples, peaches and limes, concentrated to their essence and geléed, enriched with pure vanilla and clover honey and dusted with cinnamon. Doesn't that sound good?",Special Select Late Harvest,95,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,White Riesling,Arrowood
US,"A strongly flavored Cabernet, powerful in blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, that impresses for sheer volume, although it is drinkable now with a brief decant. It's a bit rude now, but could calm down and develop some bottle sophistication in a few years.",Block Collection Walking Tree,88,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"A nice Zinfandel that's dry and fruity, with briary, brambly blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors. It's a clean, vibrant Zin, but a very tough, tannic one. Needs ultrarich fare to crack through the astringency.",Two Patch,88,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"A beautiful example of a fine Alexander Valley Cab, with dusty tannins and an herbal, thyme and sage note to the ripe blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar.

US,"One of the richest Zins on the market now. Enormous in blackberry, cherry, raspberry, blueberry and every other kind of berry flavors, with a coating of melted milk chocolate, sweet red licorice and Fig Newton. If that sounds sweet, it tastes that way, too, although the rich tannin-acid balance pushes everything toward table wine dryness.",Todd Brothers Ranch Old Vines,88,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars

US,"This is a gorgeous wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's light and delicate, but powerful, and boasts delicious cherry pie, cassis, cocoa, char and spice flavors. It possesses the kind of tannins that are soft and sweet now, but firm enough to hold the wine for many years. Best now, or anytime through 2015.",T-bar-T Benchmark,96,70,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Iron Horse
US,"Sebastiani knows how to make good Cabernet. It's wired into their hard drive, and with this lovely '07, they've again succeeded. The wine is dry, elegant and drinkable now with upscale fare. It shows the herbal quality of Alexander Valley Cabs, with a sage note to the blackberries, cherries and sweet tobacco.",,90,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"A beautiful wine, pure and gentle yet powerful. Softer than Napa, maybe earthier, with lush red cherry and vanilla cream flavors sprinkled with a dash of crème de cassis and dusty cocoa. The sweet, toasty caramel from oak char shows on the finish. Drink now–2009.",T-bar-T,93,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Iron Horse

With blackberry, leather, teriaki beef and spice flavors, it will be a good companion for smoky ribs.",,88,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Seghesio
US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008.",,85,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano
US,"A lovely, complex and flavorful Cab, but also tannic, giving it a lockdown feeling. There's a rich core of blackberries, black currants, spices and herbs, while new oak gives it a savory smokiness. Better after 2010, and should glide through 2014.",,92,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"With its Landslide bottling, Simi brings to the table an important, affordable single-vineyard Cabernet. It typically shows a beautiful balance of sweet, ripe fruit and firm tannins, backed by crisp acidity, and is big enough to handle considerable oak. Young and juicy, it's delicious now, and should develop through 2012.",Landslide Vineyard,92,33,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
US,"Owner Kenny Kahn reserves the “Best Barrel” designation for his best wine. This year it's a Malbec. Pours inky black, and explodes with blackberry pie filling, chocolate, plum sauce, licorice and cedar aromas. Drinks as powerfully rich as it smells, offering immense flavors and luxuriously smooth, velvety tannins. Very soft. Drink now through 2009 before the fruit fades.",Best Barrel,92,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Malbec,Blue Rock
US,"Here's a young Cabernet that's rich in complex, sweet tannins. The fruit shows all the hallmarks of the vintage, wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry and chocolate flavors with an extravagant coating of toasty new oak. It's awfully good now, and should be opened by 2010 or so because of the softness.",Bell Mountain Vineyard,92,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Medlock Ames
US,"Well-structured, with firm tannins and acids framing herb, cherry and blond tobacco flavors, with just a touch of smoky oak. The dry finish makes it particularly elegant.",Estate,87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass. Shows a lightness and airy feeling that differentiates it from the heavier cult Napa style. Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving.",Scion,93,58,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Young
US,"A beautiful Bordeaux blend, rich and flavorful, brimming with blackberries, black currants, black cherries, herbs and new oak. Feels fine and elegant in the mouth. Ready now for its elegant approachability, but has the tannic structure to age through 2014. Right up there with Stonestreet's more expensive wines, which makes it a comparative value.",Fifth Ridge,92,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Stonestreet

It's an early-drinking wine of elegance and delicacy.",Cyrus,87,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Not only is this a deliciously drinkable wine, it has lots of complexity and should even improve for a couple of years.

Best now–2010.",Bell Mountain Ranch Red,91,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Medlock Ames
US,"Trentadue's La Storia bottlings are their reserves, and the designation is justified for this Zin. Soft and melted in texture, with succulent wild blackberry jam, milk chocolate and cherry flavors, it's very dry, with gentle tannins. There's a butterscotchy, vanilla richness on the finish that probably comes from charred oak.",La Storia,91,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Trentadue
US,"At four-plus years, the wine is hanging in there, maintaining fruit and freshness and picking up some aged, dried pineapple and peach character. It's an interesting wine, picking up textural complexities, but needs to be drunk soon.",Reserve,90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mosaic
US,"Very rich and extracted, and much more full-bodied than Sausal's “Family” Zin, with which it was co-released. This is one to cellar for a few years, to let things come together. Just massive in chocolate, berry jam and pepper spices, wrapped into firm, refined tannins.",Private Reserve,92,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal

US,"Not in the same league as the opulent '02, the '03 is drier and less ripe, although it has an elegant tannic structure. The cherry and cassis flavors have a strongly herbal edge of dried thyme and dill. Drink now.",,87,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Artesa
US,"If you know those Argentine Malbecs, you know what you're in for. This is a dark, huge, tannic, explosive red wine, with massive blackberry and cherry, cocoa and sweet leather flavors.

US,"Just beautiful, showing Alexander Valley Zin at its best. Dry and full-bodied, it's enormously flavorful in spicy wild berries, with a cherry liqueur smoothness. But it's not high in alcohol, and is thoroughly balanced and elegant.",Family Estate Grown,92,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal

The softness may limit ageability.",,89,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Rock
US,"Soft and juicy, with extremely ripe fruit that's almost jammy, this 100% Cabernet is complex and interesting. It immediately flatters with upfront blackberry tea, a honeyed cherry liqueur taste and plenty of toasty oak, then pulls back and shows a deeper, earthier side. Drink now–2010.",Redgrav Vineyard,89,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard

It's the kind of Cab made for drinking with food, not worshipping. Should develop well over five years or so.",Reserve,88,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mosaic
US,"Not the most immediately enjoyable Cab from this venerable winery, but it could improve. Right now, it's tannic and a little sweet in cherry-blackberry fruit, and finishes with a burn, despite moderate 14% alcohol. Might just need a year or so to knit together.",,85,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley Vineyards

Almost seems underpriced for what you get.",Reserve,88,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Mosaic
US,"Easy to ripen, hard to achieve balance and elegance. That's Viognier, and Iron Horse does one of the better jobs.

Drink now.",Bell Mountain Vineyard,87,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Medlock Ames

US,"I have watched this wine for some time and know that it is an ager, especially in a great vintage like this one.

US,"This vineyard has been the source of a string of rich, complex, classic Zins from Bella, and the '05 is the best yet. It's a big, lusty wine whose volume is pumped up with a dose of Petite Sirah. The flavors run toward blackberries, boysenberries, plums, coffee, carob and Asian spices.",Big River Ranch,91,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"Tough, dry and weedy, with astringent tannins. Clean, but not going anywhere.",Cloverdale Ranch,82,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Pellegrini
US,"Dull and medicinal, with LifeSaver candy cherry and raspberry flavors.",Estate Grown,81,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Sausal
US,"The overwhelming impression is of strong, astringently dry tannins that absolutely limit pleasure. Is it worth cellaring? There's a deep core of black cherry and cassis fruit and adequate acidity. The wine will undoubtedly throw sediment and soften, but that doesn't equate to improvement. Your best bet is to decant and drink with rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",Reserve,86,46,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"Shows a velvety soft texture and immediate, easy to like flavors of blackberries, chocolate and cedar. The balance of acidity, alcohol and tannins suggests aging possibilities. Best now through 2011 before the fruit goes.",Reserve Alexandre,87,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Geyser Peak
US,"A lush, satisfying wine that shows the soft tannins and herbal character that marks Cabs from this northern Sonoma County appellation. Smooth and dry, its flavors are of blackberries, sage, tobacco, anise and cedar.",,87,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Roth
US,"A problematic Cab, with overripe, raisiny berry flavors side by side with herbal ones of oregano. There's also a weird, medicinal sweetness.",Sonoma Reserve,81,17,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Bois
US,"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years.",Symmetry Meritage,95,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rodney Strong
US,"Marlstone is an old, historic, proprietary wine, but it's been under-performing for some years now. A Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, this wine is good but has a rustic edge to the very ripe berry and cherry flavors. It should be better.",Marlstone,85,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Clos du Bois
US,"So soft and melted, it has almost no backbone at all, but there's a nice, grippy dusting of tannins, and the flavors work, so it's okay. Shows berry-cherry fruit with an earthy, dried herb quality.",,85,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arbios
US,"The tannins are dusty and astringent and give the wine a lockdown character, so you'll want to cellar this one. Aging is no problem. The wine is dry and balanced, with a rich array of blackberry, pomegranate, cola, sweet leather, coffee and spice flavors that have been generously oaked. Should improve by mid-2008 and evolve for another few years.",,90,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Blue Rock
US,"A bit sharp in acids, but the wine nonetheless has attractive Cabernet flavor, ripe tannins, and finishes with a dried herb taste. Seems like it was picked early. Try decanting for an hour or so before serving.",Symmetry Red Wine,85,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Rodney Strong
US,"The aromas suggest key lime pie topped with whipped cream and a sprinkling of white chocolate, but itÕs surprisingly soft and featureless in the mouth. There are peach flavors, but ultrasoft acidity turns them syrupy. An aggressive overlay of oak only adds vanilla. Seems like an afterthought by the winemaker.",,84,,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Soft, simple and sweet, with cherry jam and mocha flavors that finish sugary, and ample tannins.",,82,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lake Sonoma
US,"Not as rich or long in the finish as the Special Select bottling, this sweetie shows much of the same character. It's honey-sweet and crisp, with apricot, peach, vanilla and wildflower flavors.",Late Harvest,89,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,White Riesling,Arrowood
US,"As softly gooey as a sauce you'd pour over sponge cake or ice cream, with blackberry, blueberry and peppery rum and plum flavors. Dry and delicious, but really needs more acidity, structure, tannins, or all the above.",,85,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Blue Rock
US,"I get the idea of this wine. It's to craft a mountain Chard that's lean and acidic now, but a cellar candidate. It is indeed tight and austere, not offering a lot of satisfaction beyond oak and a hint of spicy pear on the finish. If you're adventurous, hold until 2006.",Upper Barn,89,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet

Instantly appealing, and versatile at the table.",Reserve,88,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Bois
US,"A little too soft and bland for my taste, although it's nicely dry, with modest alcohol and finely meshed tannins. Tastes surprisingly thin for this excellent Cabernet vintage.",Meritage Red Wine,84,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Mosaic
US,"Smells distinctly Porty, with caramel and baked brown sugar, and turns meltingly soft and sweetish in blackberry pie filling and sweetened espresso flavors. Drink now.",La Storia Meritage Red Wine,84,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Trentadue
US,"Ripe and intriguing, and holding onto its form after four years. Delivers some creamy lemon pudding aromas that are backed by flavors of citrus, apple and egg yolk. Solid on the finish, and appealing. Even offers a bit of cannoli/crème brûlée flavor at the end.",Upper Barn,88,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Stonestreet
US,"The Youngs produce a stunning Cabernet from their vineyard on the eastern benchlands of the valley. This Cab is the polar opposite of Napa, and defines the alternative possibilities. Soft, intricate and herbal-earthy, it has beautiful black cherry, cocoa, tobacco and new oak flavors, and it's thoroughly dry. Drink now through 2015.",Scion,95,54,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Robert Young
US,"Wow. For eleven bucks, and maybe even less discounted, you get a dry, rich, balanced Cab filled with real varietal character. It shows soft flavors of blackberries and cherries, with herb and olive nuances. Great value.",,87,11,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kirkland Signature
US,"What went wrong in the making of this wine was excessive sugar. It's so sweet, it's off-dry, a serious flaw in a table wine, and a disservice to consumers who expect a Sauvignon Blanc to be dry.",Spring Hill Vineyard,80,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Gann
US,"Thin and simple, with modest strawberry flavors and a watery finish. It's also soft and flabby. Iron Horse's Pinot Noir blush wine, at the same price, is an incomparably better wine.",Rosato di Sangiovese,83,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Iron Horse
US,"The mouthfeel on this 100% Cabernet is tough in tannins, with an astringent, sandpapery feeling. Still, it's dry and balanced, with a rich vein of blackberries, black currants and herbs, accented with spicy, 50% new French oak. Give it a good decant before drinking.",Director's Cut,87,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"A Bordeaux blend based on Merlot, from Goldschmidt Vineyards, and quite a good value. Dry and rugged in tannins, it shows ripe flavors of blackberries, black cherries, chocolate, anise and smoky oak.",Crazy Creek Estate,86,11,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Fidelity
US,"Overripe and raisiny, with a sweet-and-sour sharpness. Not a bad wine, but rustic.",,82,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Field Stone
US,"Semi-sweet, with a sugary, Porty taste and, paradoxically, green, minty flavors and high acids. Not exactly flawed, but a difficult wine.",,82,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Trentadue
US,"Raw, sweetly medicinal and acidic, offering little pleasure. Okay in casual circumstances.",Geyservile Estate,81,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trentadue
US,"Smells just gorgeous and tastes the same way. This is a Cab to savor. It's pure Alexander Valley, soft, dry and complex, with rich cherry and vanilla fruit, accented by smoky oak. The tannins are gentle and finely grained.",,90,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Good price for this smooth Merlot. It's very frontal in flavor, with a taste of chocolate-covered cherry candy, but it's dry, with a lingering finish.",,87,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt
US,"The ripest of Bella's current quartet of Zins, this two-vineyard blend has pie-fillling flavors of black currants, cherries and cocoa, with a raisiny edge and a spicy finish. Although it's relatively low in alcohol, the wine finishes hot.",Two Patch,87,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"It's disturbing to taste a wine so dominated by sweet vanilla and toasty char, especially when the underlying wine is as good as this one seems to be. Buried under all that wood is a crisp, pineappley and minerally Chardonnay of considerable sophistication.",,86,39,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Young
US,"Lovely young Cab, with that softly tannic, earthy, dried herb and cherry thing that so distinguishes Alexander Valley. The wine has an elegance and refinement that make it fine now for upscale food, but it should age well and improve for a decade.",Staten Family Reserve,90,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Field Stone
US,"An exotic style, but despite some shortcomings it's an interesting Cab. Almost overripe, with raisiny flavors and a slight burn, but it's good raisins, as you'd find in a currant pastry tart. Gets better in the glass. A wine to contemplate.",,88,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Scherrer
US,"Shows brisk acidity for this warmish appellation, with upfront, pineapple custard, peach tart and apricot cobbler flavors wrapped in a honeyed mouthfeel. Just when you think it's a simple Chard, it reveals all kinds of layers.",,87,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Summers
US,"This is a great price for a blush wine of this quality and complexity. It's very dry, yet with a fruity sweetness of strawberries and cherries. Wonderfully fresh and clean in vibrant acids, it's hard to believe it was unoaked because it's so creamy.",Rosato di,87,12,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Iron Horse
US,"This is a limited-production line from this venerable winery. It's a very dense, focused Cab, a little too tightly wound to pop the cork quite yet. There's a sharp pine or balsam zinginess that's a combination of smoky oak and deeply ripe cassis, fresh and zesty and dry. The wine needs time for all this to mellow. Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond.",Alexander School Top of the Crop,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Gets the job done with gooseberry, grapefruit and fig flavors and mouth-cleansing acidity. Basically dry, but there's a honeyed, fruity finish.",,85,16,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Field Stone
US,"This is really a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft and polished, it shows herb and cassis flavors, wrapped in rich smoky oak, with a long, dry finish. The tannins are quite strong now, giving the wine a chewy toughness and suggesting moderate aging. Hold until after 2008.",E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate,90,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gia Domella
US,"This everyday wine starts with a blast of cat pee, then offers more generous fig, honeydew, apricot and citrus fruit flavors that finish dry, or nearly so. Zingy acidity makes it all clean and vibrant.",,84,14,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Château Souverain
US,"Simple, rustic and raw in acids, with semi-sweet blackberry and cherry jam flavors.",,82,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Field Stone

It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",Wetzel Family Estate,88,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Does just what you want a Cab at this price to do, offering soft, immediate pleasure with extra points for complex elegance. You'll find cassis, cherry, sage and cedar flavors wrapped into ripely sweet tannins, with a finish of authority.",,88,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lake Sonoma
US,"Geyser Peak released their regular ‘04 Cab many months ago, at a lower price, but this is not a better wine despite the reserve designation. It's ripe in black currant, herb and oak flavors, with soft, supple tannins.",Reserve,86,49,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"Artesa takes a different approach to this difficult variety, blending it with Merlot, Malbec, Grenache and Grenache Noir. The result is more complex than the usual California Tempranillo, while retaining a silky, Pinot Noir-esque mouthfeel. Fully dry, the wine tastes a little baked in smoky pie-filling cherry flavor.",Reserve,85,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Tempranillo,Artesa

US,"Really too ripely sweet and hot for comfort, even though the alcohol is only 14%. Tastes like oven-baked cherries and blackberries, with lots of caramel.",,83,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vin Nostro
US,"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",Stone,82,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Shows the softness of Alexander Valley Chardonnay, and the delicious complexity that these wines can attain. Apricots, pineapples, peaches and Meyer lemons are the fruits, framed by vanilla and smoke from new oak, and finishing with a minerality that must come from the earth.",,90,26,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Summers
US,"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices. The wine is fully dry, with finely meshed tannins, but the main quibble is that it's too soft to be completely balanced.",,88,48,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Ledson
US,"Reserve Alexandre is always a really nice, interesting wine, but with recent price increases, consumers should be wary. The '04 shows classic Alexander Valley softness and herbs, along with cherries, blackberries and oak, and it's an elegantly balanced wine. But it doesn't seem to be an ager, as it's a little thin on the finish, so drink now.",Reserve Alexandre Meritage,87,56,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Geyser Peak
US,"This isn't a very complex Merlot, but it is textbook if you're looking for soft fruitiness. It has oak-influenced cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of violets and fruit tea, and is dry and dusty in tannins. Give it more concentration and it would be a star.",,87,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Geyser Peak
US,"Soft, dry and satisfying, this is a gentle Cabernet for everyday drinking. It has pleasant flavors of blackberries, currants, cedar and spices.",Lot 126,84,13,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Cameron Hughes

US,"If you like tart, green gooseberries in your white wines, this is for you. It has that rather vegetal, feline flavor, alongside riper lemons and limes that finish basically dry and crisp.",Croft Vineyard,83,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,J. Rickards
US,"A sound, fruity, if rustic Zinfandel. It's soft and slightly sweet, with candied blackberry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper, licorice and spice flavors, and a coating of caramelized oak.",Ancestor Selections Vineyard,83,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,J. Rickards
US,"Dry, tannic and fiercely astringent, this Cab has modest cherry-berry flavors. O.K. for an everyday full-bodied red with cheeses and rich meats.",,84,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Khroma
US,"Very rich, extracted and soft in tannins and acids, a melt-in-your-mouth Zin with almost sweet flavors of milk chocolate, crushed ripe cherries, licorice, caramelized wood and oodles of black pepper. Should develop over the next 4–6 years.",Century Vines Estate Grown,88,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"A solid Cabernet, with earthy flavors of blackberries, tobacco, sweet dried herbs and smoke. Ready now with a juicy steak.",Mavericks Signature Series Special Blend,88,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"Pretty obvious in sun-ripened blackberries and cherries that are sweet and jammy, while sweet oak adds vanilla and caramel richness. It's all flavor but not much structure. Drink now.",,84,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Optima
US,"Soft and still fairly tannic at the age of four–plus, with the herbal taste that often marks Alexander Valley Cabs. Yet there's enough blackberry, currant and cocoa richness to satisfy. Should develop over the next six years.",Estate Grown,87,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sausal

US,"Barely acceptable. Dry, harsh and vegetal.",Discovery,80,11,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Q
US,"Hard mountain tannins characterize this Cab, which was grown above 2,000 feet in the Mayacamas. It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring. Best 2012–2018.",Christopher's,96,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",,96,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy

US,"A difficult wine to like. Shows a mixture of unripe, herbal flavors with jammy sweet ones. There's also a note of vegetal asparagus all the way through.",,80,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mantra
US,"A great Bordeaux-style wine that can stand proudly next to Napa bottlings that cost far more. It's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four permitted Meritage varieties, and there seems to be lots of new, sweetly toasted oak. The blackberry, cherry, red currant, mocha and bacon flavors are delicious, but even better is the tannic structure. It's soft and alluring enough to drink now.",Symmetry Red,94,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Rodney Strong
US,"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.",Vyborny Vineyard,95,70,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6–8 years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.",Redwood Ranch,93,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Joseph Jewell

US,"Notable for its richness and concentration of fruit, and also for the finesse of the tannin structure. Feels softly lush and luxurious, with potent blackberry and cherry-pie filling, raspberry liqueur, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood flavors. Needs time to resolve its elements. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar.",Oliver's Blend,92,105,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Skipstone
US,"Big, tough, gutsy, fruity, tannic. In other words, Petite Sirah, and classic at that.

Good now, and should develop over a decade.",Staten Family Reserve,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Field Stone
US,"Always an interesting wine, and one that's made to drink with food. Dry and balanced, it shows flavors of blackberries, herbs and oak, with a soft, velvety mouthfeel. Made from all five of the traditional Bordeaux varieties, it should evolve over the next 6–8 years.",Cyrus,92,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"A beautiful wine, lush and appealing and at its best for the next 5–7 years. It's soft but enormously rich and smooth in tannins, with deep, extracted flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants, bacon, licorice, cola, dried herbs and sandalwood.

Made in the modern cult style, it's accessible now due to the softness.",Nicole's,93,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Lancaster
US,"A terrific Zinfandel, beautiful to drink now for its soft richness. Flatters the palate with deep, lingering black cherry and raspberry pie filling, vanilla, Indian spice and sandalwood flavors, but is completely dry, with rich, intricate tannins. Only 190 cases were produced, but worth the search.",Old Vines,92,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Miro
US,"Good price for a Cab this good. It's dry, rich and complex, with blackberry, cherry, currant and herb flavors wrapped into firm, dusty tannins. Not an ager, but beautiful now for its elegance.",Estate Vineyards,90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Fairly dark and full-bodied for a rosé, but the wine is completely dry and crisp in acidity, and the cherry, orange rind and spice flavors are nicely grounded with minerals. A serious rosé that you can drink with steak or lamb chops.",Reichel Vineyard Rosé of,90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Respite
US,"A very fine Cabernet. Not quite in the league of the '04 and '05, but rich and complex, a wine to drink now and over the next few years.

US,"A strongly flavored Cabernet, powerful in blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, that impresses for sheer volume, although it is drinkable now with a brief decant. It's a bit rude now, but could calm down and develop some bottle sophistication in a few years.",Block Collection Walking Tree,88,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"A nice Zinfandel that's dry and fruity, with briary, brambly blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors. It's a clean, vibrant Zin, but a very tough, tannic one. Needs ultrarich fare to crack through the astringency.",Two Patch,88,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"This Zinfandel specialist tries its hand at Cabernet, with excellent results. With modest alcohol, the wine is thoroughly ripe, showing complex flavors of blackberries, crème de cassis, herbs and cedar. It will be fascinating to watch this Bordeaux-style wine develop over the years.",,92,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hobo

Kosher.",Special Reserve,92,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog

US,"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",,93,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forefathers
US,"Aged for more than two years in new oak, this 100% Cab bursts with smoky vanilla and char that currently dominate its underlying fruit. But it's likely that time in the bottle will meld everything together. The powerful black currant, black cherry, carob and tobacco flavors, wrapped into rich, soft tannins, suggest holding at least through 2008, and the wine should develop well for a decade.",Winemaker's Reserve,92,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Souverain
US,"Sweet in fruit, like pastry filling, and softly tannic, this ripe, direct Cab has rich flavors of blackberries, cherries, cassis, mocha and anise, enhanced by smoky oak. It's a lush, elegant wine for early drinking.",Estate,87,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"Impresses for the sheer power of ripeness, but also and especially for the structure. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa, herbs and sweetly smoked oak are beautiful and complex, yet the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. This single-vineyard wine is one of the finest Sonoma County Cabernets of the vintage. Should age effortlessly through 2014, growing purer and more elegant.",Rockaway,96,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong

US,"A noble red wine, based on the finely ground tannins and superb integration of fruit and oak. There's a purity to the complex waves of blackberries, currants, Canadian bacon, dried herbs, black pepper and sandalwood, with a minerally tang that must come from the soil. Wonderful now, this great Syrah should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years.",Van Ness Vineyard,94,53,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Palmeri
US,"This is Geyser Peak's barrel-fermented Chardonnay.

Very nice now with roast salmon, crab or a simple roast chicken.",Block Collection Water Bend,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Geyser Peak
US,"If you buy this 100% Cab, don't even think of drinking it now. Put it in the cellar and be patient. It has the soft tannins and herbal quality of a fine Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but it's just not ready to drink now. Give it until 2012, at least, to let the cherries, cocoa and red currants transmogrify to sweet mellowness.",Lone Tree Vineyard,93,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forefathers

US,"Here's a polished young Merlot that's sophisticated enough to accompany a fine meal, yet doesn't selfishly demand all the attention to itself.

Will take some age, and should be terrific with roast pork.",,90,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sebastiani

US,"Fruit and spice star in this bone-dry Cabernet. It's very forward in blackberries, cherries, currants and dark chocolate, while the spice shows in the form of pepper, clove and star anise.

US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, grown further north than the winery's amazing Rockaway bottling, which is to say in a hotter area. Comparisons are inevitable. Although it's rich and even dramatic, it's not as impressive a wine, showing a raisiny edge to the black currants and chocolate. Doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink now with upscale beef and lamb dishes.",Brothers Ridge Single Vineyard,88,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Amazingly rich flavors mark this Cab, ranging from blackberries and black currants to earthier notes of herbs, cola and olive tapenade. It's dry, and the tannins are lush and easy. Super easy to drink, but could benefit from greater structure, as it's a bit too soft.",Reserve,87,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Grown at a high altitude above Alexander Valley, this Merlot shows dense, hard mountain tannins that lock it down in astringency. The question with such wines always is, will it age? In this case, despite a rich core of cherries and blackberries, it's doubtful. The wine is so unusually tough that the tannins seem likely to outlive the fruit.",Lost Pine,87,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Stonestreet

It has a honeyed finish of cassis liqueur, and is best in its lusty youth.",Todd Brothers Vineyard,87,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated Bordeaux blend is the winery's top red, and in the warm vintage of 2004, they've produced a balanced, rich wine that needs time. It shows classic flavors of currants, chocolate, sweet tobacco, herbs and cedar, but the tannins are fresh and arch. Should develop gracefully over the next 10–12 years.",Cyrus,92,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards

US,"Held back, for some reason, for more than six years, this wine is showing beautifully now. Exhibits really fine structure, with firm but soft tannins and good acidity framing blackberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors that are just on the verge of turning complex in the way of old wines. Should continue to evolve in interesting ways over the next 3–5 years.",,94,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Ledson

US,"Expensive, but worth it if you're a fan of rich, opulent Zinfandel. Shows Alexander Valley soft tannins and an herbal, sage and oregano edge to the enormously ripe blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, spiced with a great burst of black pepper. Notable for balance and elegance despite the power. The consulting winemaker was Merry Edwards.",,92,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Starlite

US,"This is a limited-production line from this venerable winery. It's a very dense, focused Cab, a little too tightly wound to pop the cork quite yet. There's a sharp pine or balsam zinginess that's a combination of smoky oak and deeply ripe cassis, fresh and zesty and dry. The wine needs time for all this to mellow. Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond.",Alexander School Top of the Crop,92,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley Vineyards

US,"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years.",Symmetry Meritage,95,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rodney Strong
US,"There's a good wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to taste it. The flavors of caramel and butterscotch swamp the underlying pineapples. Oakophiles will love it.",Island Block,84,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Murphy-Goode
US,"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",Redwood Ranch,85,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Field Stone

US,"This is really a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft and polished, it shows herb and cassis flavors, wrapped in rich smoky oak, with a long, dry finish.

US,"A blend of Cab and Syrah grown on one of the winery's mountain vineyards, this first-rate wine demands time in the cellar. Bone dry, it shows dramatic layers of blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate, herbs and spices, wrapped in a firmly tannic, complex structure. Has that inimitable feeling of importance, but it would be a shame to pop the cork before late in 2008. Should come into its own 2009–2012.",Prevail West Face,93,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano
US,"A beautiful wine, pure and gentle yet powerful. Softer than Napa, maybe earthier, with lush red cherry and vanilla cream flavors sprinkled with a dash of crème de cassis and dusty cocoa.

US,"Like all Rosenblum Zins, this is a big, tannic wine, with an enormous explosion of fruit. In this case, though, it's dry and balanced.

Drink soon.",Harris Kratka Vineyard,88,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum

US,"With its Landslide bottling, Simi brings to the table an important, affordable single-vineyard Cabernet. It typically shows a beautiful balance of sweet, ripe fruit and firm tannins, backed by crisp acidity, and is big enough to handle considerable oak. Young and juicy, it's delicious now, and should develop through 2012.",Landslide Vineyard,92,33,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
US,"Owner Kenny Kahn reserves the “Best Barrel” designation for his best wine. This year it's a Malbec.

Drink now through 2009 before the fruit fades.",Best Barrel,92,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Malbec,Blue Rock
US,"Here's a young Cabernet that's rich in complex, sweet tannins. The fruit shows all the hallmarks of the vintage, wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry and chocolate flavors with an extravagant coating of toasty new oak.

US,"This is a reserve bottling of Goldschmidt's regular Vyborny bottling. It's essentially the same wine, but far more tannic, and perhaps a touch more concentrated. Dustily dry and astringent now, it seems like a guaranteed cellar candidate, with its rich core of blackberries, currants, mocha, herbs, anise and cedar. Better after 2011, and for many years.",Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.",Prevail Back Forty,93,85,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano

Delivers all the wild, brambly Zin quality you want, with tiers of blackberries, cherries, cassis, cherry liqueur, tobacco, vanilla and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish.

The result is more complex than the usual California Tempranillo, while retaining a silky, Pinot Noir-esque mouthfeel. Fully dry, the wine tastes a little baked in smoky pie-filling cherry flavor.",Reserve,85,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Tempranillo,Artesa
US,"With jammy peach, apricot, pear and pineapple fruit flavors, this is a pretty nice everyday Chard, at a fair price. It has a creamy texture and a spicy aftertaste.",,85,13,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Geyser Peak
US,"A little rugged around the edges, with some uneven tannins, but it's drily elegant, and offers a wealth of blackberry, black currant, cola, anise and herb flavors, accented elegantly with smoky oak. Should develop in the bottle over the next 3–5 years.",Baby Blue,87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Rock
US,"This very dry Syrah has soft tannins and a full-bodied mouthfeel, with complicated flavors of baked cherries, cola, bacon and sandalwood. It's quite a good wine, but astringent now, making for a puckery feeling. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with rich fare.",,87,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Blue Rock
US,"Lots of bang for the buck here. Offers mouth-filling, juicy blackberry, cherry, pomegranate and coffee flavors in a bone-dry, soft wine, with a fairly complicated tannin structure. Drink now.",,87,15,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Praxis
US,"Not the richest Merlot Geyser Peak has ever made. The wine is totally dry and fairly tannic, with dried herb, licorice and cherry flavors. Best thing about it is the structural elegance.",,85,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Geyser Peak
US,"A fine Chardonnay, which Ferrari-Carano can usually be depended on to produce. Shows crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple jam, butterscotch, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Easy to find, with 42,000 cases produced.",,89,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Not the most immediately enjoyable Cab from this venerable winery, but it could improve. Right now, it's tannic and a little sweet in cherry-blackberry fruit, and finishes with a burn, despite moderate 14% alcohol. Might just need a year or so to knit together.",,85,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Although there's promise, this is rustic now, with very dry herb, rhubarb, cola and cherry flavors that finish with a tannic, peppery astringency.",Limited Release,85,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Artesa
US,"Marlstone is an old, historic, proprietary wine, but it's been under-performing for some years now. A Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, this wine is good but has a rustic edge to the very ripe berry and cherry flavors. It should be better.",Marlstone,85,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Clos du Bois
US,"So soft and melted, it has almost no backbone at all, but there's a nice, grippy dusting of tannins, and the flavors work, so it's okay. Shows berry-cherry fruit with an earthy, dried herb quality.",,85,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arbios
US,"Pellegrini's Cabs always seem to have a rustic edge, meaning the sharp-elbowed tannins, and the green, dried herb flavors that dominate. The wine's structure is great, but it would really benefit from more fruity richness.",Cloverdale Ranch,84,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pellegrini
US,"Rugged and kind of sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and mint julep flavors, this Zin has dusty, briary tannins and a mouth-watering spiciness that calls for steaks and chops.",Sin Zin,84,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Really too ripely sweet and hot for comfort, even though the alcohol is only 14%. Tastes like oven-baked cherries and blackberries, with lots of caramel.",,83,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vin Nostro
US,"Sausal's old vines are about 50 years old, which may account for the unusual concentration and balance of this wine. It floods the mouth with blackberry, spice and mocha flavors, yet is dry and balanced and not at all hot. Drink now.",Old Vine,86,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"A bit sharp in acids, but the wine nonetheless has attractive Cabernet flavor, ripe tannins, and finishes with a dried herb taste. Seems like it was picked early. Try decanting for an hour or so before serving.",Symmetry Red Wine,85,55,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Rodney Strong
US,"A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass. Shows a lightness and airy feeling that differentiates it from the heavier cult Napa style. Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving.",Scion,93,58,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Young
US,"What a nice Zin. Shows all the Dry Creek character you could ask for, with briary, brambly flavors of wild forest berries, peppery spices and chocolate-covered mints. Savory and delicious, a fine wine to drink now with barbecue. Alcohol is very high, but somehow the wine doesn't taste hot.",Stone Ranch,89,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,DeLorimier
US,"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",Stone,82,27,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Super-fruity, offering a blast of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, persimmons, red plums and bacon, finished with enormous spices. The wine is technically dry but tastes sweet with high-alcohol glycerine and smoky oak. Drink this strong, uni-dimensional Zinfandel now.",Stone,85,29,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Very rich and extracted, and much more full-bodied than Sausal's “Family” Zin, with which it was co-released. This is one to cellar for a few years, to let things come together. Just massive in chocolate, berry jam and pepper spices, wrapped into firm, refined tannins.",Private Reserve,92,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"As softly gooey as a sauce you'd pour over sponge cake or ice cream, with blackberry, blueberry and peppery rum and plum flavors. Dry and delicious, but really needs more acidity, structure, tannins, or all the above.",,85,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Blue Rock
US,"A bit quick on the finish, but otherwise a nice everyday Chardonnay. Shows a soft, buttercream texture, with dry, subtle flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.",,85,13,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Geyser Peak
US,"A little too soft and bland for my taste, although it's nicely dry, with modest alcohol and finely meshed tannins. Tastes surprisingly thin for this excellent Cabernet vintage.",Meritage Red Wine,84,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Mosaic
US,"Smells distinctly Porty, with caramel and baked brown sugar, and turns meltingly soft and sweetish in blackberry pie filling and sweetened espresso flavors. Drink now.",La Storia Meritage Red Wine,84,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Trentadue

US,"Dull and medicinal, with LifeSaver candy cherry and raspberry flavors.",Estate Grown,81,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Sausal

US,"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Stuhlmuller Vineyard,87,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutcher Crossing
US,"When this hilly vineyard Cab first came out, it was very good, but quality has slipped over the years. The '04 is perfectly decent in oak-infused blackberry and currant flavors and rich tannins, and it may even improve for a few years.",Landslide Vineyard,87,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
US,"Just beautiful, showing Alexander Valley Zin at its best. Dry and full-bodied, it's enormously flavorful in spicy wild berries, with a cherry liqueur smoothness. But it's not high in alcohol, and is thoroughly balanced and elegant.",Family Estate Grown,92,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"Shows a velvety soft texture and immediate, easy to like flavors of blackberries, chocolate and cedar. The balance of acidity, alcohol and tannins suggests aging possibilities. Best now through 2011 before the fruit goes.",Reserve Alexandre,87,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Geyser Peak
US,"This beautiful wine is the quintessential Alexander Valley Cabernet. It's soft and melted in texture, a gentle but complex wine with enormously rich blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. And this is a great price for the quality. Geyser Peak is at the top of their game.",,91,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"A lighter style of Zin, perfect for grilled meats and poultry. The wine is bone dry, with gentle tannins framing flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola, cocoa, cracked black pepper and Asian spicebox.",Old Vine,87,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"This dry, soft wine has slightly herbal flavors of sage that ground the ripe blackberries and cherries. It's a pleasant wine, although it's rather rustic and calls for everyday fare.",Diamond Dust Vineyard,84,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Trig Point
US,"A lush, satisfying wine that shows the soft tannins and herbal character that marks Cabs from this northern Sonoma County appellation. Smooth and dry, its flavors are of blackberries, sage, tobacco, anise and cedar.",,87,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Roth
US,"This elaborate wine totally satisfies for its rich, creamy texture and forward pineapple custard, kiwi, honeydew and tangerine flavors. As if that weren't enough, toasty new oak carries it over the finish line. Dry and balanced, lots of quality here for the price.",Island Block,91,19,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Murphy-Goode
US,"Always elegantly sleek and dry, this year's Cuvée R, a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier, shows citrus and flower flavors. Smooth and lively in the mouth, with crisp acidity. Barrel fermentation and sur lies aging make this wine unusually rich.",T-bar-T Cuvée R,91,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Iron Horse
US,"Marked by those soft Alexander Valley tannins that are so much gentler than Napa's, this Cab is a regional classic. It's a little tight now, but deliciously forward in cherry and cassis fruit, with overt oak influences. Good now with beef.",,91,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Artesa
US,"At four-plus years, this is a harsh wine, tough in tannins and over-oaked. You'll find blackberry, cherry, currant and herb flavors and a dry, hard finish. Okay for everyday fare, but pricey for what you get.",All In Claret,84,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Murphy-Goode

US,"Raw, sweetly medicinal and acidic, offering little pleasure. Okay in casual circumstances.",Geyservile Estate,81,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trentadue
US,"Shows the softness of Alexander Valley Chardonnay, and the delicious complexity that these wines can attain. Apricots, pineapples, peaches and Meyer lemons are the fruits, framed by vanilla and smoke from new oak, and finishing with a minerality that must come from the earth.",,90,26,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Summers
US,"Some Viogniers are exotically fruity. Not this one, which is elegantly crisp and refined. Its lemon and lime flavors just barely nudge into wildflowers. Has a rich, honeyed finish.",T-bar-T Vineyard,90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Iron Horse

US,"Oaky and tannic, marked by caramel flavors that dominate the blackberries, black currants, cherries and chocolate. Feels heavy now, but improves in the glass. Decant, or try holding for a few years to see what happens.",Geyserville Ranch,82,48,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Trione
US,"An unfortunate wine. It may have been better a few years ago, but the fruit is fading, leaving behind a taste of vegetables and mint. Doesn't seem likely to reverse course.",Murphy Ranch Sarah Block,82,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Murphy-Goode
US,"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices. The wine is fully dry, with finely meshed tannins, but the main quibble is that it's too soft to be completely balanced.",,88,48,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Ledson
US,"Wow. For eleven bucks, and maybe even less discounted, you get a dry, rich, balanced Cab filled with real varietal character. It shows soft flavors of blackberries and cherries, with herb and olive nuances. Great value.",,87,11,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kirkland Signature
US,"It's 99% Sauvignon Blanc, with a splash of Viognier. The wine is really a wonderful barrel-fermented style, rich, unctuous and exotic in citrus, nettle and wildflower flavors. It's wines like this that are making Sauvignon Blanc a certified superstar.",T-bar-T Cuvée R,93,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Iron Horse
US,"Here's a big, rich, mouthfilling Chard. It's superoaky, superripe and just delicious, offering up a wealth of mango, guava, pineapple custard and peach pie fruit, with the crème brûlée, buttercream and buttered toast from new oak. Really good Chardonnay.",Bell Mountain Vineyard,92,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Medlock Ames
US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008.",,85,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano

US,"Smells just gorgeous and tastes the same way. This is a Cab to savor. It's pure Alexander Valley, soft, dry and complex, with rich cherry and vanilla fruit, accented by smoky oak. The tannins are gentle and finely grained.",,90,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This is a big, rich, forward, chocolaty Zin that flirts with overripeness. It's not as complex or balanced as Bella's superb Lily Hill bottling. It also goes a little raisiny and hot towards the finish. But it sure is a nice barbecue wine.",Big River Ranch,87,34,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"What went wrong in the making of this wine was excessive sugar. It's so sweet, it's off-dry, a serious flaw in a table wine, and a disservice to consumers who expect a Sauvignon Blanc to be dry.",Spring Hill Vineyard,80,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Gann
US,"The appellation says Alexander Valley, but this is a high mountain vineyard, and this Cab has some hefty tannins. It's dry and delicious, with intense black currant flavors and elaborately smoked oak. Drink now with a good steak. It may be a little too soft to endure aging.",Ash Creek Vineyard,90,40,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Imagery

US,"This is a big, tannic and dry Cabernet, but it's very elegant, and shows the pedigree of Alexander Valley at its best. Impeccably balanced in acidity and tannins, the fruit is pure blackberries and black currants, with a wonderful earthiness suggesting dried sage and thyme. Should develop nicely over the next 6–8 years.",Reserve,91,47,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"A lovely Cabernet that shows the soft tannins and earthy herbaceousness of Alexander Valley. On a fruitier note are the cherries and red currants that are accented by sweet, smoky oak.

The wine finishes dry. Drink now through 2010.",Vyborny Vineyard,90,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
US,"There's a classic Alexander Valley softness and herbaceousness to the cherry, cassis, blueberry and oak flavors of this Cab, and while it's rich and balanced enough to drink with the best steak you can find, it should age for a while. Best now through 2009.",Estate Red Wine,90,70,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Lancaster
US,"This is a beautiful Cabernet, and at this price, a super deal. It's dry and soft, with the dusty tannins and herbal flavors that mark Alexander Valley Cab. But you'll find rewarding notes of blackberries. A great job from this veteran winery.",,91,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Souverain
US,"Gia Domella scores with another fine Cabernet off this property, although this '06 is $7 more expensive than the '05.

Passalacqua Heritage Estate,90,39,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gia Domella

US,"Offers everything that Alexander Valley's famous for: a soft, easy texture, slightly herbaceous flavors of cherries and cassis, and lots of elegance. This unfiltered Cab is totally dry and nicely balanced.",Unfiltered,89,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meola Vineyards
US,"Here's a very ripe Cabernet Franc whose plummy flavors veer into dried prunes. It's dry, and a little hot, but there's something nice about it. It's honest and forthright, and will support food without overwhelming it.",,86,48,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Ledson
US,"Hits the palate with acidity so high, it's almost searing. Not unpleasant, but certainly calls for the softening effects of food. Pleasant flavors, too, of ripe passionfruit, zesty pineapple, crisp green apple and honeysuckle, and a finish of real complexity.",,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Desperate White

US,"This vineyard has been the source of a string of rich, complex, classic Zins from Bella, and the '05 is the best yet. It's a big, lusty wine whose volume is pumped up with a dose of Petite Sirah. The flavors run toward blackberries, boysenberries, plums, coffee, carob and Asian spices.",Big River Ranch,91,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"This Cab is a little soft, and not all that fruity, so the dry tannins stick out, but it's so balanced and understated that it's a natural to accompany good food without overshadowing it. The cherry, cassis, herb and coffee flavors are lightly seasoned with oak. Drink now.",Estate,88,38,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Icaria Creek
US,"Here's a deliciously drinkable Cab, bursting with flavors of sun-ripened cassis and black currant fruit flavors, and a generous coating of well-toasted oak.

US,"Here's a classic Alexander Valley Cab from a winery that knows what it's doing. The wine is very soft but complex and elaborately tailored, with delicious blackberry pie, chocolate and cherry flavors that just don't stop coming. Fortunately, the tannins and acids are rich enough to stand up to the fruit.",,90,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"Rather hard in tannins now, a tough young wine that will rise up to something like short ribs. Best to leave it alone for 3 or 4 years. Blackberries, rich and intense, form its heart.",Murphy Ranch,90,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Petit Verdot,Murphy-Goode

Should improve by mid-2008 and evolve for another few years.",,90,36,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Blue Rock

Try holding until 2007.",Robert Young Vineyard Reserve,90,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Murphy-Goode
US,"This is a sort of junior version of the winery's All In Claret, and it suffers from the same sugar problems. The alcohol is moderate, but it's almost as candied sweet as a dessert wine.",Wild Card Claret,81,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Murphy-Goode

US,"Murphy-Goode has a history of producing quality Bordeaux blends. But there's way too much new oak here, 100 percent in fact, and that, on top of a residual-sugary finish, pushes this wine into unbalance.",All In Claret,80,45,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Murphy-Goode

Best now through 2012.",Reserve,90,46,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak

US,"This mountain Cab has a very dark color, and the tannins are intense and scouring. Will the core of black cherry and blackberry fruit outlive the tannins? The jury's out, but it merits this score by virtue of its overall class and distinction. If you open it now, decant for as long as you can.",Block Collection Kuimelis Vineyard,90,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"The ripest of Bella's current quartet of Zins, this two-vineyard blend has pie-fillling flavors of black currants, cherries and cocoa, with a raisiny edge and a spicy finish.

US,"The Youngs produce a stunning Cabernet from their vineyard on the eastern benchlands of the valley. This Cab is the polar opposite of Napa, and defines the alternative possibilities. Soft, intricate and herbal-earthy, it has beautiful black cherry, cocoa, tobacco and new oak flavors, and it's thoroughly dry. Drink now through 2015.",Scion,95,54,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Robert Young
US,"Robert Young is one of Alexander Valley's greatest wineries. After others achieved success with their Merlot grapes, they started making their own wine, and consumers are the beneficiaries. Truly soft and voluptuous, yet richly structured, the wine is totally dry, with a dried herb edge to the cherry flavors. The complexity is enormous, but somehow the wine remains delicate and elegant.",,94,42,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Robert Young

US,"Robert Young's Scion has become the quintessential Alexander Valley Cab. The opposite of a big Napa Cab, it has a soft, gentle texture, with good cherry and anise flavors, and a rich gout de terroir earthiness. Not an ager, it's among the best drink-now Cabs of the vintage.",Scion,92,54,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Robert Young
US,"Starts with apricot, orange, honeysuckle and vanilla aromas. Curiously, the concentration and intensity the aroma suggests isn't there. Finishes weak.",Select Late Harvest White Riesling,84,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Riesling,Arrowood
US,"The softness and herbaceousness, and the light structure, define this as Alexander Valley, albeit a very fine specimen. With a little Cab Franc, the wine defines a feminine elegance, with cherry, herband oak flavors. Beautiful and complex now, this wine should gain complexity over the next five years.",Reserve,91,60,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
US,"It's disturbing to taste a wine so dominated by sweet vanilla and toasty char, especially when the underlying wine is as good as this one seems to be. Buried under all that wood is a crisp, pineappley and minerally Chardonnay of considerable sophistication.",,86,39,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Young
US,"So good, it makes you want to shout. Possesses the beautifully ripe flavors that are expected of a great vintage, such as blackcurrant, cherry, white chocolate and cassis, with extra edges of smoky caramel and vanilla. The tannins are perfect, soft and easy, but as rich and complex as a Renoir. Differentiates itself from Napa with its softness and accessibility, but as great as anything from across the Mayacamas.",Scion,96,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Robert Young
US,"This Cab is dry, fruity, soft and gentle, with extra nuances of complexity. It's deep in blackberry and chocolate flavors, and an intricately detailed balance of acids, tannins, alcohol and oak.

US,"From longtime Simi winemaker Nick Goldschmidt, now with Allied Domecq, the wine he really wants to make. It is ripe and rich, with flavors of blackcurrants and cassis, and the velvety soft tannins the appellation is famous for.

US,"From vineyards quite high up in the eastern mountains, this wine is from stressed, low-yielding grapes. The blackberry and cassis flavors are concentrated and dense, and the tannins are tough and firm. Oak plays a supporting role. Rich foods, such as lamb or gongonzola cheese, will soften and sweeten it, but you're best off cellaring for a few years.",Alden Vineyards,91,30,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong

US,"A challenging wine, made all the more so because there's a beautiful entry and the wine has truly delicious aspects. It's softly complex and beguiling, with cherry custard, vanilla and smoky oak flavors, and shows real finesse. On the other hand, the short finish suggests it's not going anywhere, so drink up.",Estate,89,65,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lancaster
US,"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points. The flavors are wrapped in soft, easy but complex tannins. Fully dry and nicely oaked, this wine is immediately enjoyable.",Winemaker's Reserve,90,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Château Souverain

There's a pretty coating of oak leading to a long, fruity-spicy finish.",Belle Terre Vineyard,89,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Winemaker Erik Olsen says the Tempranillo needs really careful tannin management—he even blends in Cabernet Sauvignon to soften this wine.

Drink now.",Alexander's Crown,90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Named after the pioneer who settled Alexander Valley, this wine, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, is very dry and pretty tannic right now. It has a wealth of black cherry, blackberry jam and sugared espresso flavors. Needs time, but it's a classy wine, and should be best by 2008.",Cyrus,89,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"My one non-Oz wine is this rosé; it falls more into the “light red” than “pink-colored white” category, in terms of weight and flavor. Berry aromas have cream-nutty accents, while on the palate the berries take on earthy nuances. From Iron Horse, who are as adept at big reds as they are at sparklers, and continues to surprise us.",Rosato di Sangiovese,86,10,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Iron Horse
US,"Good Cab from a hot vintage in a hot valley. The wine sure is ripe, with cassis and plum flavors dusted with cocoa, and dry, with enough tannins to leave the palate puckery. It straddles the line between drink-me-now and a more complex age-me, without resolving the issue.",,88,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wattle Creek
US,"Shows real classy Syrah character in the peppery, meaty aromas and flavors, and plenty of ripe, fruit and berry complexities. Also demonstrates the balance this winery is known for. Actually more of an old-style field blend, with other Rhône varieties.",,87,20,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Château Souverain
US,"After two years in French oak, the tannins are soft, but the acids still evident. Has pretty aromas and flavors of vanilla, tobacco, smoke and cassis, just seems a bit hard-edged on the finish.

US,"Like many of the Clos du Bois wines, this is textbook. There's everything you expect in a Merlot—black cherries, vanilla, toast, dried herbs, coffee. On the other hand, also like a textbook, it lacks the drama and excitement to push it into the next class.",Reserve,87,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Clos du Bois
US,"Easy and soft, as befits the variety and appellation, and has extra layers of complexity that make it very good. Rich in blackberries and flowers, with subtle oak and a good backbone of acidity to cut through that steak or lamb.",,87,18,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Château Souverain
US,Shows lots of rich varietal character and classy tannins that frame cassis and mocha flavors  that finish dry. There's a bit of sharpness mid-palate that suggests a few years of age will help the wine work out its kinks. Best 2007–2009.,Cloverdale Ranch,87,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pellegrini

US,"Beautifully drinkable in the prime of its youth, with subtle blackberry, cherry, herb and violet flavors folded into soft, dusty tannins. Perfect now with a well-marbled steak, but should age short-term.",Reserve,88,32,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Lyeth
US,"With fruit sourced from everywhere from Dry Creek to Carneros, this Cabernet-based wine is a good, blended effort, with true varietal character if no particular complexity.

US,"Dry, tannic and ungenerous, not showing the softness and fruitiness you'd expect. Still, it's a well-made wine, with a core of black cherry fruit, and might improve. Try cellaring through 2005.",,85,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Reflections
US,"A little thin in fruit, with modest citrus and melon flavors encased in proper acidity, with a touch of oak. Picks up steam on the finish, but could use a bit more concentration.",Spectrum Reserve,85,16,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,DeLorimier

US,"From one of the highest vineyards in the Sonoma Mayacamas comes this profoundly structured, deeply tannic Cab, which also is quite oaky. Bone dry and relatively closed and astringent, it's of very fine quality, |and desperately needs time. Twenty years isn't out of the question to allow the nuclear core of blackberries and cherries to unfurl.",Hawkeye Mountain,93,50,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"What an amazing record Robert Young has with its Chardonnay, which has been famous as a vineyard-designate by Chateau St. Jean since the 1970s. As ever, the '03 is rich and opulent, soft in acids and instantly addictive for the purity of fruit. Peaches and cream star, with a baked meringue complexity that's simply irresistible.",,92,37,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Young
US,"Compared to the winery's '02 Reserve Cab, this is less tannic, more accessible, due to the dominance of Merlot in the blend. Still, it's a tannic young wine, dry and astringent despite rich cherry and mocha flavors. It is not particularly drinkable now, and is not a longterm bet. Drink 2007–2010.",Reserve Alexandre Meritage,88,49,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Geyser Peak

US,"The overwhelming impression is of strong, astringently dry tannins that absolutely limit pleasure. Is it worth cellaring? There's a deep core of black cherry and cassis fruit and adequate acidity. The wine will undoubtedly throw sediment and soften, but that doesn't equate to improvement. Your best bet is to decant and drink with rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",Reserve,86,46,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak

Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price.",Botrytised,95,55,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sémillon,Chalk Hill
US,"If you like some green herbaceousness in your Cabs, which some say makes them more Bordeaux-like, this is for you. It's very dry and somewhat tannic and extremely elegant, with oak-inspired blackberry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. A lovely, upscale restaurant wine.",Estate,92,65,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chalk Hill
US,"Expensive, but brilliant. At the forefront of California Sauvignon Blanc. Shows bright and clean acidity framing intense tangerine, lime and honey flavors, as well as complications from oak. Yet it finishes bone dry and elegant. Delicious and compelling, this wine lifts Sauvignon Blanc into entirely new territory.",Musque,95,40,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
US,"A gorgeous wine, dry and complex, whose natural fruit richness and acidity have been accented by full-bore Burgundian treatment of sur lies and oak barrel aging. It's basically a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrus flavors and a mouthwatering green fruit taste that suggests limes and kiwis. Combines a bracing quality with richness, and the result is compelling.",,94,40,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Gris,Chalk Hill
US,"A bright, beautifully brisk Sauvignon Blanc, marked with crisp acidity and racy flavors of citrus fruits and gooseberries, accented with sweet oak. It's a creamy, deliciously complex wine, and although it's fully dry, it finishes with a honeyed richness.",Estate,92,33,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
US,"A spectacular dessert wine. The residual sugar is 18%, making it superrich in honeyed sweetness, complexed with apricot, pineapple, pear, vanilla cream and new oak flavors of butterscotch and crème brûlée. But it's also crisp in acidity, giving it a clean scour. One of the best sweeties of the vintage.",Estate Vineyard Selection Botrytised,95,80,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sémillon,Chalk Hill
US,"An exquisite Merlot that really impresses for balance and complexity, and not just its ability to ripen grapes, which anyone can do. Shows deep flavors of cherry purée, mocha, cedar and Asian spices, wrapped into finely ground, sweet tannins. A rewarding red wine for drinking now with upscale fare.",Estate Bottled,92,51,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Merlot,Chalk Hill
US,"Right up there with the '06, Chalk Hill's 2007 Sauvignon Blanc is a rich, ripe wine. It shows flavors of pineapples, green apples, Asian pears and nectarines, with barrel fermentation notes of vanilla, butterscotch and honey. Delicious and complex.",Estate Bottled,92,33,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
US,"Near perfect in the way it tastes almost sweet, then pulls back into dryness. The flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, peaches and honeysuckle are made even more delicious by the judicious application of new oak and sur lie aging.",Estate Bottled,93,30,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill

US,"Here's a Bordeaux blend that aims high and largely succeeds. It's soft and intricate despite the thick tannins, with a mouthfeel like wool. Turns flavorful in blackberries and black currants, with more feminine hints of violets and lavender, then shuts down again on a tannic finish. Better after 2012.",FURTH,92,150,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chalk Hill
US,"Chalk Hill is attempting to create a world-class PG, full-throttle with ripe fruit and sur lies, produced from selected blocks in the estate vineyard. But at three-plus years, the wine is losing the charm and vibrancy of its fruit, and is picking up the brittle, decaying character of a white wine that's too old.",North Slope,84,40,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Chalk Hill
US,"Steve Leveque, the winemaker at Chalk Hill, is doing everything right. Everything he touches is gold, including Cabernet. The '03 is extraordinarily balanced and beautiful, a dry, ripe wine of power and full-bodied substance, but enormous subtlety. The cassis fruit meshes seamlessly with toasty new oak to produce compellingly complex flavors. Drink now through 2010.",Estate Bottled,94,64,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chalk Hill
US,"Warm summer weather ripened the grapes to black cherry and cocoa perfection, while cool nights preserved vital acidity. The oak tastes new and is in full balance with the wine's size. Despite a touch of raisins, this wine should hold and improve for five years before gradually losing fruit.",Estate Bottled,92,43,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Merlot,Chalk Hill
US,"ultrarich, maybe too much so for elegance, with powerful caramel and vanilla crème brûlée flavors overpowering the pineapples, peaches and green apples. Still, there's no denying the deliciousness. Crisp acidity fortunately provides balance.",Estate Bottled,89,48,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chalk Hill

Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price.",Botrytised,95,55,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sémillon,Chalk Hill
US,"A very good, immediately impressive Cabernet. We've never seen Chalk Hill Cab of this quality at this price. It shows powerfully oaked, ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants and spices, wrapped into fine, dense tannins. Just what Cab lovers love. Easy to find, with 8,606 cases produced. Drink now.",Lot 140,89,16,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cameron Hughes
US,"This very dry wine is earthy, with a dusty, tannic flavor of hazelnut skin and a slight bitterness, but it rewards with deeper tastes of white peach, and a rich overlay of oak.",Reserve,85,30,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"On the heavy side, with full aromas of toast, baked fruit and spice. Stylistically, this falls into the category of barrel influenced; there's vanilla, licorice and resin accents to the spicy apple and melon fruit flavors. Finishes quite dry and spicy, and here the oak notes take over a bit more than they should.",,87,25,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
US,"If there's any fruit in this massively oaked wine, it's hard to find. Little but char, vanilla and toast hit you, with a sweet dill finish.",,82,13,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,STG
US,"Made with 82% Cabernet, this interesting wine is showing all kinds of possibilities. It's a good red now, sturdily dry and tannic, with red cherry, pomegranate, sweet tobacco and allspice flavors. But it's a little juvenile. I would decant it as long as possible, and it should enjoy a cellar life of up to 10 years.",Chairman's Club,91,85,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,Chalk Hill
US,Shows some nicely ripened pear and peach flavors that are enriched with sweet vanillins and toasty oak and a hit of yeasty lees. A firm spine of acidity provides cleanliness and balance to this tasty Chard.,,88,18,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Smells odd and vegetal, an unripe scent that is not attractive. Marginally better in the mouth, with berry and herb flavors and sturdy, tough tannins.",,82,22,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Syrah,Chateau Felice
US,"As good as Herzog's Special Reserve Cab is, this one is better. It has the same ripely fruity currant and cassis flavors, with fine tannins and a luxurious coating of oak that has been judiciously applied. But it goes the extra mile in finesse and balance, and is simply superb. Right up there with the best, and a considerable success for the vintage.",Special Edition Warnecke Vineyard,93,52,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
US,"Compared to a lush Napa Cab, this has a distinct green olive and French-cured olive character. It must be the terroir, but oak, toasted and spicy, plays an important part. Finally, there's Cabernet's inherent currant flavor. The wine is thoroughly dry and balanced, with smooth tannins. It's a unique Cabernet, but in its own way, very fine.",,90,66,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chalk Hill
US,"This ultraexpensive Chardonnay comes down along mineral, steel and wet stone flavors. It's well-oaked,  although you'll find tropical fruit, subtly, on the finish. It's extremely elegant, with a long draw of acidity and a classic structure.",Estate Vineyard Selection,90,67,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chalk Hill
US,"There seems to be a great deal of new oak here, to judge by the fresh, strong aromas of vanilla, cedar and smoky char, but those scents mesh well with the cassis, mocha, peat and anise that come from fruit. There's also a leathery thing going on, a little sweaty, but it adds a spicy complexity.",Estate,89,43,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Merlot,Chalk Hill
US,"Lemony and grassy, this very dry, tart wine is refreshing and zesty. Sur lie aging has given it body and structure, while a good proportion of new oak gives complex notes of smoke and vanilla. Totally dry.",Estate,88,25,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
US,"Solid and elegant, this standard-bearer offers round, plummy aromas and flavors, as well as cocoa and tobacco accents. The fruit is very clean and bright, and the flavors well defined on the lush, well-balanced palate. Finishes dark and juicy, with fine tannins. This wine should improve over the next three to five years, and then drink well until 2008.",Estate Bottled,90,50,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chalk Hill

US,"A big mouth-filling offering with lots of oak/cedar and coffee/mocha shadings. Sweet-and-sour stewed berry flavors and black-toast accents play on the fairly large-scaled palate. A tart chocolate note enters on the finish, which displays firm but fine tannins. It's the best Cabernet we've ever tasted from this Kosher winery, and it should improve over the next two to four years.",Special Edition Warnecke Vyd,89,42,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
US,"Long known for their powerful, elegant Chardonnays, Chalk Hill's 1998 offering is impressive for its complex array of aromas and flavors.

This refined wine exudes finesse and refinement.",Estate Bottled,91,40,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chalk Hill
US,"Richer than the '03, this wine brims with the most savory Meyer lemon, lime and tart green-apple flavors, boosted and brightened with crisp, minerally acidity. Winemaker Steve Leveque barrel fermented this non-malolactic wine for the first time, to make it a little rounder and creamier. It was a good step; the wine is luscious.",,91,25,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
US,"Super-ripe grapes put their shoulder to the wheel for a highly extracted wine characterized by masses of peach and pear flavors. Oak contributes added spice, vanilla and smoke. It's as plush as could be, but it's also soft and a bit flabby. An impression of sweetness lingers in the finish.",,87,18,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Grippy leather and tobacco provide a gravelly texture and burly nature to this medium-bodied wine, which finds its groove in the glass.

US,"There's nothing shy about this Zin, which showcases both the variety's personality and the wine's terroir. The raspberry, licorice and espresso flavors have a sweet edge of brown sugar.

US,"This wine offers a lighter side of Petite Sirah.

US,"Frankly as sweet as Port, with sugary blackberry jam and chocolate-covered raisin flavors and high, brandied alcohol. Not bad for a dessert wine, but inappropriate for a table wine.",Dorothy's Vineyard,83,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Wilson
US,"Lots to admire in this single-vineyard Zinfandel from Zin's natural home, Dry Creek Valley. It's rich in ripe summer berry and spice flavors, with briary, fuzzy tannins. Two problems, though. It's too sweet, and high alcohol makes it feel hot.",Grist Vineyard,85,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Jewell
US,"A joy to drink. It's so ripely exuberant in fruit, explosive in wild berry, dried red currant, licorice, cocoa and dusty spice flavors that sink deep into the palate and last forever on the finish. Yet it's dry, and the structure is entirely elegant. The two vineyards that are source to this wine are old and dry-farmed. A very great Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel, a real classic. Drink now–2015.",Cortina,95,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"As chewy and umami, salty delicious as a mouthful of crunchy bacon. Throw in dried blackberries and blueberries, with a touch of smoky new oak, and that describes this fantastically pure, addictively good Zinfandel.

Truly a great Zin, and relatively easy to find, with 9,000 cases produced.",Old Vine,94,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"A fantastic Zinfandel, Sbragia's best in years, and one of the best of the vintage.

US,"There's nothing elegant about this Cabernet, but it does score high on the deliciousness scale. Shows Dry Creek's rustic tannin structure, with a scoury mouthfeel, but the blackberry, blueberry and currant flavors, which are accented with smoky oak, are incredible. Drink it over the next few years, and watch it change as it breathes in the glass.",Andolsen,92,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"Marked by big, ripe, juicy blackberry, raspberry and currant fruit, this single-vineyard Syrah is saved from simplicity by two things. There are complex notes of bacon, sautéed mushrooms, black pepper and smoky oak, and the tannins are wonderfully rich and ripe. Really delicious. Probably best soon, though, before the fruit fades.",Grist Vineyard,91,23,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Bradford Mountain

US,"Hobo has a knack for taking Zinfandel's wild, briary personality and wrestling it to as much elegance as a Dry Creek Zin is capable of. True to form, Hobo accomplishes that.

US,"Rich in blackberry, black currant and pepper flavors, and completely dry, but kind of rustic and awkwardly hot in the mouth. There's a sharp edge of green tannins.

US,"Basically a high-alcohol fruit bomb, with jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries. The heat from 15.5% alcohol gives it a chili pepper burn. Defines that style, for those who like it.",Canis Major Perotti Vineyard,84,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mutt Lynch
US,"A big, heavy, full-bodied and ripe Zinfandel that needs rich, greasy meats and cheeses to tame it. The blackberry, currant and dry chocolate flavors are huge, and the tannins are even bigger, giving this extremely dry wine an astringent finish.",Tori's Reserve,88,44,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"Strongly extracted and oaky, this Cab isn't showing much finesse now. It has jammy, pie-filling blackberry and cherry flavors, liberally spiced and wrapped into chewy tannins. Will age without developing complexity.",Taylor Reserve,87,41,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dutcher Crossing
US,"Dry and full-bodied, with robust flavors of wild red, blue and black berries, currants, cola, dark chocolate and oodles of peppery spices. Feels brisk and tannic in the mouth, with a balanced, classy finish. A beautiful Dry Creek Zin for drinking now.",Wine Creek Ranch,90,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"A good example of a ripe, robust Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. It's huge in extracted blackberries, blueberries, chocolate and currants, with all kinds of tangy baking spices. Almost too much of a good thing, but Zin lovers will exult.",Lily Hill Estate,88,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"Some Zins are “claret style,” made with the elegant structure of Cabernet Sauvignon. Not this one. It's pure, classic Dry Creek, showing that region's robust, slightly rustic tannins, explosive wild berry fruit and loads of briary, peppery tannins. It's a very fine Zin that calls for upscale beef, pork and chicken dishes.",Unfiltered,90,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Optima
US,"Bright, distinctive fruit impressions pop through a layer of smoke and bacon aromas as this full-bodied but balanced wine opens up. Jazzy flavors like raspberry and cranberry meld with bass notes like blackberry as firm tannins and good acidity give it great structure, too.",Lily Hill,92,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"A big, full-bodied Cabernet, dry and smooth in tannins, with blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors. There's an earthiness that grounds this wine, making it less flamboyant than a Napa Cab, but food friendly and easy to drink.",,88,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VC Cellars
US,"A nice Zin made in Mazzocco's bold, ripe style, and since it's as good as their more expensive Zins, a comparative value. Shows massive flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice and cola, leading to a dry, somewhat hot finish.",Briar,87,29,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Another fine, food-friendly Sauvignon Blanc from Lake Sonoma. It's vibrant in mouthwatering acidity, with a clean, minerally scour that frames ripe flavors of lemons, limes, oranges and honey.",,87,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Lake Sonoma
US,"Just about as big, powerful and impressive as the variety gets. The wild berry, currant, smoked meat, tobacco, licorice and white pepper flavors explode in the mouth, contained by big, tight tannins. Right now there's a sharp cut of acidity that detracts, but the tartness should help the wine age. Give it 4-5 years in the cellar.",Aguilera Reserve,90,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Mazzocco
US,"Zins hardly get much bigger or bolder than this one. With very high alcohol, it's dry and full bodied, with a glyceriney mouthfeel to the blackberries, cola, mocha and peppery spices. Drink now.",Reserve West Dry Creek,87,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"This wine over-delivers a mouthful of juicy quality vis-a-vis price, combining Cab with smaller dabs of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Savory blackberry and cassis lift the fruitiness, seasoned in savory tones of black tea and cranberry that give it an edge. Fleshy and smooth, it's a good wine to stock up on.",,91,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Dry, bitter and tannic. Mouth-numbing astringency overwhelms the modest blackberry fruit. Ready now.",Canis Major,82,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Mutt Lynch

US,"Made in the Mazzocco style of high alcohol and superripeness, this Zinfandel, which contains a splash of Petite Sirah, tastes like Port. The flavors of raisins and currants dominate, and it bears glycerine sweetness and jalapeño-like heat.",Seaton,84,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco

Drink this potent wine with barbecued pork, chicken and beef, slathered in spicy sauce.",Florence Vineyard,87,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"The aroma is all caramelized wood and the dominant flavor is buttered toast and caramel. Wood tannins also come into play, adding to the grape tannins to make for a tough mouthfeel. Somewhere in there is a pretty good Syrah with blackberry flavors. Decanting helps a little, but the oak may never integrate.",Block 9,86,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Terlato
US,"This Zinfandel tastes and feels hot and Port-like. While some people enjoy this style, it feels a bit clumsy and overripe. Nonetheless, the blackberry, raisin and chocolate flavors are tasty.",Briar,82,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"A big, rich, lusty Petite Sirah, filled with sweetly delicious blackberry, raspberry, cherry and cedar flavors. It's a little hot in alcohol, with thick, grippy tannins, but hey, it's Petite Sirah. Great now with barbecued ribs slathered in spicy sauce.",Aguilera,89,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Mazzocco
US,"Shows the edgy tannins that Dry Creek red wines invariably display, with a sandpapery texture. That makes the wine, which is a Bordeaux blend of five varieties, a little rustic. But the dryness and bite are a nice alternative to the riper, softer Napa style, and more versatile at the table. Good now, and should slowly develop in the bottle for years.",The Mariner,92,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Somewhat crude and angular now, but then again, it's Petite Sirah, and mountain-grown at that. Shows considerable tannins and fresh acidity, with compact flavors of wild black and blue berries, licorice, currants and peppery spices, finshed with a flourish of dark chocolate. A very fine wine that needs time. Better after 2012.",Dry Creek Mountain Vineyard,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Gustafson Family
US,"Rich and flamboyant in all kinds of berries: blackberries, blueberries, boysenberries, mulberries and cherries—plus chocolate. The tannins are big, the wine full-bodied and slightly coarse, the finish sweet and jammy.",Pony Reserve,89,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Mazzocco
US,"Shows Zin's wild, briary personality, with spicy flavors of ripe summer berries. An exuberant wine that wants barbecue and marinara-sauced pasta dishes to set it off. Don't forget the grated cheese.",Rattler Rock Old Vine,86,29,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Truett Hurst
US,"A little sugary sweet and simple, but appeals for its wealth of cherry, raspberry, cocoa, anise, vanilla and toast flavors. Earns an extra point for polished tannins. Drink now.",Bench Vineyards,86,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Pedroncelli
US,"Made in a superripe, high-alcohol style, this Zin may be an acquired taste, but if you like this approach, it's a sensation. Dry, soft and a little hot, it shows massive blackberry tart, black cherry pie, blueberry jam, chocolate, anise, pepper and Indian spice flavors. Almost Port-like, but never loses essential control, and a fine example of Dry Creek.",,92,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gustafson Family
US,"This rich, spicy Zinfandel defines the Dry Creek style. It's fruit-forward in briary, brambly berry and currant flavors that have hints of anise and chocolate, and is dry, with sturdy tannins and a balancing cut of acidity. Very enticing. Only 150 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",Grist Vineyard,91,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Jewell
US,"A bit overripe, with a chocolate-covered raisin edge to the blackberry, cola and oak flavors. Turns almost sweet on the finish. More rusticity is added by the tannins, which have a dry, herbal feeling. Drink now.",Nevins Vineyard,86,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dutcher Crossing
US,"A solid Zinfandel, a little sweet but not too much, with softly drinkable tannins. The flavors are ripe, suggesting raspberries, cherries, mocha, brown sugar, cinnamon and cloves.",,86,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
US,"Shows a distinguished structure and mouthfeel proving that Dry Creek Cabs are really moving forward. Quite different from Napa in the briary, brambly, wild berry flavors, almost like Zinfandel, and the brisk tannins. This food-friendly wine will perform well on a restaurant wine list.",Estate Grown,91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mounts
US,"Spicy and exuberant, if not particularly subtle, a big, juicy wine to drink with steaks and roasts. Bone dry, and pretty tough in tannins, it has flavors of blackberries, leather, cola, coffee and pepper. Ready now.",,86,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Terlato
US,"A very good, dry Zinfandel, rich in ripe fruit and smoky oak. With thick, furry tannins, it shows classic Zinny flavors of wild berries and dusty Asian spices. Great price for a Sonoma Zin of this quality. Drink now.",,87,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"Shows a certain rustic simplicity now, with youthfully jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants, sprinkled with cocoa and pepper and wrapped into dusty tannins. Might develop some bottle complexity down the road, but not a longterm ager. Now–2013.",Wine Creek Ranch,87,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Quivira

US,"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel that shows the variety's rustic, briary character. It's dry and tannic and rather high in alcohol, with flavors of wild, ripe forest berries, peppery spices, currants, bacon and sweet, smoky cedar. Nice now with BBQ.",,87,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Adobe Road
US,"Richness alone would earn this Zinfandel a good score, but the overall balance uplifts it. It's simply delicious in wild berry, spice, mocha, salty bacon, vanilla toast and sandalwood flavors. Yet the tannins are fine, and the acidity is perfect. Even the slightly sweet finish and high alcohol work.",Sawyer Vineyard,90,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"This is a soft, very ripe and rather one-dimensional Syrah. It has lush flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate, sweet olive tapenade, peppery spices and smoky cedar. At its best now with grilled meats and hard melted cheeses.",Kemp Vineyard,86,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Adobe Road
US,"This rich, fruity Cabernet comes from one of the higher mountain regions in Dry Creek Valley. It's enormously concentrated in blackberry, black currant and oak flavors, with the briary, peppery note so often found in Dry Creek reds. Fairly tannic, it leaves a trail of astringency after you swallow. Good, if a little rustic. Give it three or four years to come around.",Watchtower Vineyard Estate,90,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gustafson Family

US,"The problem with this wine is excessive alcohol. Officially, it's 16.5%, which is almost Port. However, this Zin is dry. Yet it can't outrun the taste of overripe raisins. Not for everyone, but a decent example of its style.",Red Rooster Old Vine,84,29,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Truett Hurst
US,"Good and dry, with complex layers of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, herbs and oak. The tannins are wonderfully firm and refined. Suffers a little from excessive acidity, which makes it uncomfortably sharp. Drink now.",Mountainview Ranch Winemaker's Reserve,87,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kokomo
US,"Mourvèdre is one of the toughest varieties to grow, but Quivira does a good job with this smooth, polished bottling, which is 100% varietal.

Ready now.",Wine Creek Ranch,86,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Mourvèdre,Quivira
US,"There's something rustic and spicy and earthy about Dry Creek Chardonnays, but Ed Sbragia manages to lift this wine into opulence. It's pretty oaky, yet the vanilla and honey flavors marry perfectly with the pineapple and pear fruit to produce a wine of great attraction.",Home Ranch,92,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sbragia
US,"Shows the rustic side of Petite Sirah, with big tannins, crunchy acidity and juicy berry, pomegranate, currant, grilled steak and black pepper flavors. Tastes raw and immature now, and should be cellared for 3–4 years.",Hillside Estate,87,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Collier Falls
US,"The alcohol level is very high, but the wine is very delicious, which is the tradeoff you get with this Zinfandel taste-alike. It's silky and soft and rich in jammy raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, finished with savory spices.",,87,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Primitivo,Collier Falls

US,"Grab your hamburgers and grilled sausages and wash them down with this spicy, rich Zinfandel. It's silky and sweet in cherry, raspberry and currant flavors, with an edge of milk chocolate and sandalwood. The alcohol is very high, but in keeping with the wine's overall balance.",Private Reserve,87,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Collier Falls
US,"Shows Zinfandel's rustic, rugged side, with irregular tannins, high alcohol and ripe berry fruit and spice flavors. Almost as sweet as a minor Port. Ready to drink now.",Pauline's Vineyard,84,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
US,"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",Pauline's Vineyard,89,37,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Papapietro Perry

It has polished flavors of raspberries, rose petals, gingersnap cookie and peppery spices, and the finish is super-dry. Nice with bouillibaisse, or try with cured meat appetizers.",Estate Grown,89,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Fritz
US,"Awkward, with sweet, glyceriney flavors augmented with blackberry jam and toast. High alcohol creates some heat.",Maple Vineyards,83,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Armida
US,"This is a fairly sweet interpretation of Sauvignon Blanc, offering flavors of pineapple and pear juice, apricot jam and vanilla.

Exudes quintessential Zin character, with a mouthburst of red currants, black raspberry pie filling, wild cherries, sweet charred oak and masses of freshly crushed black pepper.

Production of 921 cases is decent in the old-vine Zin category.",Old Vine Estate,95,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Zichichi Family Vineyard
US,"A beautiful massive, mouthfilling Zinfandel. Impresses on every level, from the smooth, rich tannins to the dryness and above all the depth and range of flavors.

The alcohol is 15.5%.",Cortina,94,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio

US,"Big in berry and currant fruit, high in alcohol, hard in astringent tannins. Brazen indeed. But you know what? This Zin pulls off its balancing act.

US,"Here's a big, thick, full-bodied and extracted wine that captures the essence of Dry Creek Valley Zin. Its marked by extremely briary, brambly flavors of wild blue and black berries and cola. Then the spices kick in, starting with black pepper, ranging through cinnamon and star anise, and then finishing with black pepper.

US,"Hard to believe this Sauvignon Blanc never saw oak, because it has a vanilla bean flavor that must come from the grapes alone, although lees aging surely contributes to the creaminess. The underlying flavors are complex, ranging from Meyer lemons and sweet limes to exotic tropical quince, kiwi and guava and just a touch of gooseberry. Best of all is the acidity, which brightens everything. A great Dry Creek Sauvignon Blanc.",,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Stephen & Walker

Drink now with very rich grilled meats, stews and hard cheeses.",Estate,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Zichichi Family Vineyard
US,"An interesting Syrah and quite a good one despite some youthful vigor. The tannins are aggressive and accentuate the acidity, making the wine feel tough in the mouth. But it's extraordinarily rich. Floods the palate with intensely ripe blackberries and blueberries, with cool-climate notes of black pepper. Give it a good decant before serving.",Reserve,92,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Montemaggiore
US,"This is a tannic, full-bodied Syrah, and while it's not an ager, it's quite delicious now because of the well-ripened Syrah flavors that Dry Creek does so well.

US,"Good for the winery for making a bone-dry, crisply tart rosé wine that stands for elegance and finesse, which is not the easiest thing to do with a blush Syrah.

US,"Gigantic is just one word to characterize this Zinfandel. For starters, it's enormously high in alcohol—at 16% by volume, it's almost Port-like. Yet it's dry and smooth in tannins, and the heat gives a heady boost to the black currant, black pepper and sweet oak flavors. Not for everyone, but it defines this powerful Dry Creek style of Zin.",Rage,88,59,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Michael David
US,"Smooth and rich, this has pleasing flavors of blackberries, currants, dried herbs and cedar that are marked by firm tannins. Dry and full-bodied, it's a classic Cabernet to drink now and over the next four years or so while it's still fresh and fruity.

US,"Tastes pretty sweet, like a good Syrah that's been doctored with a tablespoon of white sugar. If that's your style, you'll enjoy the rich cherry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors.",,86,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longfellow
US,"Feels hot and tastes sweet, putting it at the rustic end of the Zinfandel spectrum. The official alcohol is 15.3%. At that level, of course, you also get enormously ripe berry flavors. Drink it with barbecue or meat stews.",Mounts Vineyard,85,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
US,"Shows the dry tannins and herbal quality that so often mark Dry Creek Cabs, but that also distinguish it as unique. You'll find black currant and cherry flavors awash in sage, tobacco, black pepper and even Chinese five-spice notes. The tannins are firm, but smooth, suggesting moderate ageability.",,90,55,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stromberg Vineyards
US,"Big, ripe and powerful, this brawny wine is flavorful, but not particularly delicate. It offers a blast of cherries, red currants, chocolate, violets, anise, smoky oak and pepper. Should develop over the next 4–6 years.",Home Ranch,88,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sbragia
US,"This spicy, powerful Zinfandel has 10% of Petite Sirah blended in, which adds depth, richness and tannins. You can call the resulting wine rustic, in the sense of its wild berry and spice flavors and briary, brambly mouthfeel. But it's also classic Dry Creek Valley. Drink over the next few years with barbecue, or try a Mexican-inspired beef dish.",Quest,90,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"Made Northern Rhône style and blended with some Viognier that contributes lemony brightness, this Syrah is ripe in jammy blackberry, currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It's delicious, but a little too soft for aging, so drink now.",Hommage a Ampuis,89,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Quivira
US,"Considerably lighter in body and texture than your average Cab Franc, Biltmore's 2009 has the weight of a nice Pinot Noir.

An interesting wine of a place, with distinctive qualities.","Teldeschi Vineyards, Home Ranch",87,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Del Carlo Winery
US,"Surprisingly dry and crisp for a Dry Creek Valley Viognier. Usually these wines are fatter and sweeter, but not this one. It's streamlined and elegant, with savory apricot, Meyer lemon and slightly underripe white peach flavors. A nice food wine as an alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.",Grist Vineyard,89,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Horse & Plow
US,"The 6% of Viognier may be why this Zinfandel has such a zippy streak of acidity.

Drink now.",Flight,89,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira

An interesting wine to drink over the next three years for freshness.",,89,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,VC Cellars
US,"High alcohol gives this Zin some jalapeño-like heat. It shows classically ripe Dry Creek flavors of briary, brambly blackberry, raisin and chocolate.

Finishes thoroughly dry, but too soft in structure. Would benefit from greater architectural firmness.",,86,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"The flavors in this Zin are very lush and delicious, suggesting a mélange of crushed wild forest berries, freshly ground black peppercorn, mocha, anise and something animal, like sweet, soy-splashed grilled beef.

US,"With massive fruit and power, this low production (300 case) Zinfandel will make lovers of the Shelton style exult, while others might find it lacking elegance.

US,"Marked by big, ripe, juicy blackberry, raspberry and currant fruit, this single-vineyard Syrah is saved from simplicity by two things.

Probably best soon, though, before the fruit fades.",Grist Vineyard,91,23,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Bradford Mountain
US,"Last year's bottling of this single-vineyard Zin was very good. The '06 is right up there, although the winery has raised the price by four bucks.

Hold if you can until after 2008, and should develop well for an additional 4 years.",Adolsen Vineyard,91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"A very nice Sauvignon Blanc that shows the grassy, herbaceous edge that Dry Creek brings to so many wines. But that doesn't mean it's thin. On the contrary, it offers a rich mouth burst of citrus and tropical fruits, figs and green melons, with a touch of tart gooseberry. The finish is a little sweet in honey.",Stetson Greene Vineyard,88,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Paradise Ridge

US,"Lots to like about this Zin. It's dry, smooth in tannins and fine in acidity, and shows the briary, brambly, wild berry notes of its origin.

US,". I loved the winery's '04 Lily Hill Zin, but not this wine, because Zin can tolerate heat a lot better than Syrah. This wine is stewed and soft, with coffee flavors that taste artificially sweetened.",Lily Hill Estate,82,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Bella
US,"Take a Dry Creek Cabernet, give it a more robust body, a more rustic mouthfeel, and push the flavors toward plums and leather, and you get this old-style wine. The dry, rasping tannins suggest aging for at least eight years.",,86,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Pedroncelli

Great price for a Zin of such textbook authority.",Mother Clone,89,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pedroncelli
US,"Dry Creek Zins can be rustic, but not this one, which is closer in style to cult Napa Cabernet in the lush, soft, appealing mouthfeel and ripe flavors. It's enormously high in alcohol, (16.8%) but feels smooth, soft and polished, with raspberry-infused chocolate truffle flavors and Zin's zesty dusting of spicebox.

US,"Nicely brisk and clean in acidity, this racy wine whisks through and cleanses the palate. Along the way, it leaves bright flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits, orange blossom and honeysuckle, with a slightly tart touch of gooseberry. A very nice, unoaked wine.",Fig Tree Vineyard,88,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Quivira

US,"Here's a raspingly tannic, high-acid wine that feels astringently dry at first. Then the cherry flavors kick in, and all sorts of complexing herbs, spices and oak influences. It's an interesting red, but those tannins and acids call for something rich and Italian, like chicken cacciatore.",Artist Collection,89,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Imagery

A sophisticated wine.",,90,21,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard

Has the balance and depth of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, but with Zin's spicy, briary, brambly personality. Erupts in wild berry, currant, cola, leather, mocha and peppery spice flavors that are so rich and deep and long-lasting. Pricey, but sets a benchmark for Zinfandel.

US,"They say the vines are 68 years old, and they certainly produced a dense, concentrated young Zin. It's like the liquid essence of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, enriched with a dusting of cinnamon, cocoa, coffee and nutmeg. The finish is completely dry. One problem: acidity is very low, making the wine soft and a little medicinal.",Louvau Vineyard Old Vines,86,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars

US,"There's a savage quality to this Syrah, suggesting fresh wild berries growing in fields of lavender, rosemary and pepper tree, and something animal, like roasted meat bone. Under all that it erupts with intense cherry and blackberry fruit, and the sizable tannins make for a puckery feeling. This is quite an interesting Syrah that will gain in complexity over the next five years.",Benediction,91,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek

US,"With its bouquet of black plum, leather and dried herb notes, this lean Zin has good berry fruit. However, its attributes are balanced by a note of volatile acidity on the nose, and it shows some definite heat in the mouth.

Give it 2–3 years to mellow.",Smith Orchard Vineyard Reserve,88,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,DeLorimier
US,"Dry Creek Valley has a natural affinity for Marsanne, and particularly in this balanced vintage. The grapes got ripe in lemon chiffon, peach and honeysuckle flavors, while a clean crispness and minerality add length and palate interest. Sur lies aging in the barrel brings even richer notes of cream and smoky vanilla. This Marsanne explores the outer reaches of the variety's possibilities in California.",Preston Vineyard,92,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,JC Cellars

US,"A big, ripe, exuberant wine, offering a mouthful of blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam and oak flavors. The wine was fermented in 100% new French barrels.

It's a classy wine, bone dry, tannic and full-bodied, and while it shows the rustic, briary nature of Dry Creek Valley, it's awesome in blackberries, cherries, raspberries and mocha, with a deliciously meaty edge of bacon. There's no reason why this wine shouldn't age in interesting ways over the next six years.",Elusive,88,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style Red Blend,Quivira

The finish is a little sweet in honey.",Stetson Greene Vineyard,88,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Paradise Ridge

US,"Few wines are as ripe and fruity as this. It's explosive in raspberry jam and cherry pie flavors, with scads of dusty pie spices, and the smooth tannins make it silky in the mouth.

US,"This Cabernet has a wonderfully smooth texture. It's tasty and rich in blackberry fruit, with a touch of sweet, savory raisin and lots of exotic spice. Easy to drink this dry wine over the next few years.",T.R. Passalacqua Vineyard,88,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Owl Ridge
US,"A beautiful Syrah perfect for drinking now. It's softly tannic and dry, but very fruity, with forward flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and milk chocolate, and an earthier grounding of tobacco, anise and leather.",Wine Creek Ranch,90,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Quivira
US,"Dry and a little bitter in tannins, with flavors of cherries, cranberries and herbs. It's elegantly constructed and feels silky and balanced in the mouth. A very nice and versatile food wine that will take a few years of cellaring.",,87,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Shows the edgy tannins that Dry Creek red wines invariably display, with a sandpapery texture. That makes the wine, which is a Bordeaux blend of five varieties, a little rustic. But the dryness and bite are a nice alternative to the riper, softer Napa style, and more versatile at the table. Good now, and should slowly develop in the bottle for years.",The Mariner,92,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Somewhat crude and angular now, but then again, it's Petite Sirah, and mountain-grown at that. Shows considerable tannins and fresh acidity, with compact flavors of wild black and blue berries, licorice, currants and peppery spices, finshed with a flourish of dark chocolate. A very fine wine that needs time. Better after 2012.",Dry Creek Mountain Vineyard,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Gustafson Family
US,"Powerful and upfront in fig, citrus, honeysuckle, dusty spice and vanilla flavors, but balanced with crisp acidity and a minerally streamlined mouthfeel. A nice white wine to drink by itself, or with Asian fare.",the obvious,86,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Roshambo
US,"Simple and a little sweet, this Cab shows very ripe, jammy flavors of blackberries, cassis and cola. It's an easy sipper, with a pleasant scour of tannins.",,84,13,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sonoma Creek
US,"Made in a superripe, high-alcohol style, this Zin may be an acquired taste, but if you like this approach, it's a sensation. Dry, soft and a little hot, it shows massive blackberry tart, black cherry pie, blueberry jam, chocolate, anise, pepper and Indian spice flavors. Almost Port-like, but never loses essential control, and a fine example of Dry Creek.",,92,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gustafson Family
US,"This rich, spicy Zinfandel defines the Dry Creek style. It's fruit-forward in briary, brambly berry and currant flavors that have hints of anise and chocolate, and is dry, with sturdy tannins and a balancing cut of acidity. Very enticing. Only 150 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",Grist Vineyard,91,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Jewell
US,"This tastes juicy, sweet and vibrant, with candied raspberry, pink bubblegum, vanilla, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. A nice Zin to drink now.",Old Vine,85,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Renwood
US,"Hobo's Zins are almost always among the most balanced and elegant out there, while preserving the variety's spicy, briary personality. This lovely single-vineyard bottling is dry and refined, showing complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. Drink now.",Treborce Vineyard,92,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
US,"A textbook example of the modern, New World-style of red winemaking, this Merlot is as soft as melted butter, extraordinarily ripe and slightly sweet in the finish. The flavors are of vanilla-infused cherries, red currants and chocolate.",,84,13,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sonoma Creek
US,"Shows a distinguished structure and mouthfeel proving that Dry Creek Cabs are really moving forward. Quite different from Napa in the briary, brambly, wild berry flavors, almost like Zinfandel, and the brisk tannins. This food-friendly wine will perform well on a restaurant wine list.",Estate Grown,91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mounts
US,"An easy wine that shows Sauvignon Blanc's character in a zesty, slightly sweet way. The flavors are of pineapples, figs, lemongrass, honeysuckle and vanilla, heightened with crisp acidity.",East Side Vineyards,85,12,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Pedroncelli
US,"Dark, big, rich and tannic, but savory in ripe red currants and licorice, this slightly rustic Zin will pair well with rich meats and cheeses and especially barbecue.",,86,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Brazin
US,"A good, robust Zin that defines the high alcohol, superripe style of Northern California. With more than 16% alcohol, it has a Portiness to the blackberries, coffee and anise. Drink this strongly flavored, dry wine with barbecue or beef-centered Latin fare.",Warm Springs Ranch Reserve,86,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Mourvèdre is an awfully hard variety to get right in California, but Quivera has done an outstanding job. The wine is fully ripe, showing cassis, milk chocolate and pepperspice flavors, and it's also very soft, making it immediately drinkable. But it's the refined tannin structure that lifts it up.",Wine Creek Ranch,89,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Mourvèdre,Quivira
US,"This tastes hotter than the official alcohol of 14.4% abv, giving it a heat that combines with the pepper flavor that lends a prickliness. A flavor of overripe raisin also shows up in this dry blend, which is based on Zinfandel. It's a rustic wine for drinking now.",Lytton Springs,84,37,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ridge
US,"Just about as big, powerful and impressive as the variety gets. The wild berry, currant, smoked meat, tobacco, licorice and white pepper flavors explode in the mouth, contained by big, tight tannins. Right now there's a sharp cut of acidity that detracts, but the tartness should help the wine age. Give it 4-5 years in the cellar.",Aguilera Reserve,90,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Mazzocco
US,"Showing the briary, brambly side of Zinfandel, this features wild berry, tobacco and spice flavors. Its thinness and impression of sweetness give it a rustic mouthfeel.",,84,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Martin Family Vineyards
US,"Here's a soft, juicy Merlot. It's loaded with cherry, mocha and smoky flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. It finishes dry and spicy.",,87,17,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt
US,"This rich, fruity Cabernet comes from one of the higher mountain regions in Dry Creek Valley. It's enormously concentrated in blackberry, black currant and oak flavors, with the briary, peppery note so often found in Dry Creek reds. Fairly tannic, it leaves a trail of astringency after you swallow. Good, if a little rustic. Give it three or four years to come around.",Watchtower Vineyard Estate,90,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gustafson Family
US,"Dry and spicy, this has lots of upfront fruit in the form of wild raspberries and cherries, and rich tannins that make it great for pairing with grilled steaks and chops.",,87,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Lake Sonoma
US,"Showing the rustic tannins and peppery spices that Dry Creek Cabs usually possess, this Cab wants a little time in the cellar. With black currant, chocolate, tobacco and herb flavors, it's very close in quality to the winery's regular '05 Cab, with a little more concentration and a firmer tannin structure.",Estate,92,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fritz
US,"A tough, gritty wine, with hard, scoury tannins and the kind of brambly, briary wild berry flavors you might find in a Zinfandel. Finishes with peppery, sandpapery roughness. Might develop in the bottle, but it's a gamble.",,84,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Verge
US,"Good, ripe flavors of black cherries, anise and sandalwood in this dry wine, but it feels really rough in texture. Lacks the smoothness and polished mouthfeel you want in a red wine, especially Merlot. Ready now.",,84,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Frei Brothers
US,"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time. It displays a wealth of black cherry and currant flavors. Hold if you can until after 2008, and should develop well for an additional 4 years.",Adolsen Vineyard,91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"Ripe to the point of almost sweet, this single-vineyard Zin brims with blackberry, red currant, chocolate, licorice, cola and peppery spice flavors. With a full-bodied structure, it calls for rich, cheese-finished dishes.",Florence Vineyard,88,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"So concentrated in sweet raspberry and cherry fruit, it's basically all about jam. It's a delicious wine, a little on the rustic side, but appealing. The sweetness, tannins and acidity should allow this to pair well with Mexican food.",Grist Vineyard Old Vines,87,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Miro
US,"A big, rich, lusty Petite Sirah, filled with sweetly delicious blackberry, raspberry, cherry and cedar flavors. It's a little hot in alcohol, with thick, grippy tannins, but hey, it's Petite Sirah. Great now with barbecued ribs slathered in spicy sauce.",Aguilera,89,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Mazzocco
US,"This Zin isn't rich enough to stand up to its enormously high alcohol level, making it seem hot. Its fruit is overripe and raisiny.",,81,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bluenose
US,As sugary sweet as cherry and raspberry pie filling. Not for fans of dry table wines.,Mr. Beast,80,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Barber
US,"A little hot and peppery, but it's Sonoma Zin, and a chunk of grilled beef will be a great match to the heat and tannins. This drily robust wine has flavors of wild berries, cherries, bacon and Asian spices. Drink now.",,89,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
US,"Rich and flamboyant in all kinds of berries: blackberries, blueberries, boysenberries, mulberries and cherries—plus chocolate. The tannins are big, the wine full-bodied and slightly coarse, the finish sweet and jammy.",Pony Reserve,89,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Mazzocco
US,"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",Pauline's Vineyard,89,37,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Papapietro Perry
US,"With its tangy acidity, touches of green peppercorns and edgy tannins, this is a rustic wine. Fortunately, it has a lot of blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, with that distinctive briary character of Dry Creek Zins. Drink now with roasted or grilled meats or a vegetarian lasagna.",Piccetti Vineyard,87,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Miro
US,"One of the more successful blush wines out there, this one's crisp and elegant. It has polished flavors of raspberries, rose petals, gingersnap cookie and peppery spices, and the finish is super-dry. Nice with bouillibaisse, or try with cured meat appetizers.",Estate Grown,89,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Fritz
US,"Very ripe and jammy, a superfruity young Cab that could benefit from time in the cellar. Erupts in the mouth with blackberries, cherries, licorice, currants and cedar, wrapped into smooth tannins. Give it 2–3 years to mellow.",Smith Orchard Vineyard Reserve,88,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,DeLorimier
US,"Concentrated and intense, this Zin shows ultraripe blackberry, cherry, black raspberry, milk chocolate, coffee, Asian spice, anise and smoky vanilla flavors that linger long into the finish. It's big and brash, suggesting grilled ribs slathered with sweet barbecue sauce.",Louvau Vineyard,87,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"This is rich and ripe in blackberry, currant, mocha, tobacco, cola and spice. It has a beautiful texture, feeling softly tannic and velvety, seemingly frictionless on the palate yet with fine grip. The head-trained vines are at least 50 years old.",Maple Vineyards,93,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"The first thing to know about this Zinfandel is its extraordinarily high alcohol. The official reading is 16%. It's almost Port, except that it's bone dry. The tannins are hard, and the flavors are of ripe blackberries. Yet it's a good example of its type and deserves a good score.",Ken's Reserve,88,44,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",,87,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dogwood
US,"With over 16% alcohol and a splash of Petite Sirah, this Zin can be called generous. It has a rich, creamy texture, and the black currant, cherry jam, mocha and anise flavors are fully dry.",Reserve Pony,88,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Compared to a Napa Cab, this is a rustic, sharp-edged offering whose tannins have a jagged, green edge. But if you're complaining that Napa Cabs don't go with food, try this one. It's drily acidic and savory, with herb and pepper-infused wild blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors.",Block 007 Estate Vineyard,88,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pedroncelli
US,"Big in berry and currant fruit, high in alcohol, hard in astringent tannins. Brazen indeed. But you know what? This Zin pulls off its balancing act. It's a spicy, briary, lusty wine that will pair well with slow-cooked, braised meat dishes, like lamb shanks.",Sommer Vineyard,88,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Brazin
US,"This is Zinfandel on steroids, which is the Wilson house style. The wine is dry, full bodied and very high in alcohol, approaching 16%. Yet it's zesty and exuberant, with a wealth of blackberry, currant and pepper flavors. Distinctly Californian and Dry Creek Valley, it's a fine example of its type.",Sawyer Reserve,88,44,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"The 16.2% alcohol shows in the Porty aroma and flavor of this unusually ripe Zin. It tastes of cayenne pepper, caramelized blackberry pie filling, milk chocolate and toasted meringue, and even with all that alcohol, it's still a little sweet. You can criticize it for not being a proper, dry table wine, but it's an interesting whatever it is.",Pony,86,27,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Lots going on in this ripe, lusty Zin. It shows the spicy, briary character of Dry Creek, with wild blackberry, cherry and boysenberry flavors complexed with mocha, sweet vanilla and toast.",Old Vine,86,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Puccioni
US,"This is a soft, easy-drinking Zinfandel to enjoy now with everything from meatballs and spaghetti to barbecue. It's dry and silky, with pleasant raspberry, cherry and spice flavors.",Visionary,86,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,The Federalist
US,"A big, heavy, full-bodied and ripe Zinfandel that needs rich, greasy meats and cheeses to tame it. The blackberry, currant and dry chocolate flavors are huge, and the tannins are even bigger, giving this extremely dry wine an astringent finish.",Tori's Reserve,88,44,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"Strongly extracted and oaky, this Cab isn't showing much finesse now. It has jammy, pie-filling blackberry and cherry flavors, liberally spiced and wrapped into chewy tannins. Will age without developing complexity.",Taylor Reserve,87,41,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dutcher Crossing
US,"The vineyard sits at nearly a half-mile in elevation, and you'll find true mountain concentration to the blackberry jam, black cherry, raspberry, licorice, pepper and molasses flavors. The alcohol is quite high, but the wine feels rich and balanced.",Reserve Smith Orchard,87,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Good for the winery for making a bone-dry, crisply tart rosé wine that stands for elegance and finesse, which is not the easiest thing to do with a blush Syrah. Avoids heaviness in favor of a light, crisp mouthfeel that frames cherryskin, herb and vanilla flavors.",Heritage Tree Vineyard Estate Rosé of,88,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Gustafson Family

US,"The Yiddish word “zaftig” perfectly describes this Petite Sirah. It's big, powerful and fleshy, with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, dark chocolate, licorice, bacon and peppery spices, all wrapped into significant tannins. A very nice example of the variety, it's dry and balanced, and should age for years.",,91,27,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Kokomo
US,"Good and dry, with complex layers of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, herbs and oak. The tannins are wonderfully firm and refined. Suffers a little from excessive acidity, which makes it uncomfortably sharp. Drink now.",Mountainview Ranch Winemaker's Reserve,87,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kokomo
US,"Kind of simple and sweet, like oaky apple and pear juice. Needs greater dryness and complexity.",Handley Vineyard,83,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Handley
US,"Shows the rustic side of Petite Sirah, with big tannins, crunchy acidity and juicy berry, pomegranate, currant, grilled steak and black pepper flavors. Tastes raw and immature now, and should be cellared for 3–4 years.",Hillside Estate,87,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Collier Falls
US,"The alcohol level is very high, but the wine is very delicious, which is the tradeoff you get with this Zinfandel taste-alike. It's silky and soft and rich in jammy raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, finished with savory spices.",,87,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Primitivo,Collier Falls
US,"From a benchland vineyard, this Zin is riper than almost anything out there. Higher in alcohol, too, with an astounding 16.8%.

US,"Grab your hamburgers and grilled sausages and wash them down with this spicy, rich Zinfandel.

The alcohol is very high, but in keeping with the wine's overall balance.",Private Reserve,87,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Collier Falls
US,"Unacceptably high in alcohol, nearly 16%, this Zin is overwhelmed with heat. It's almost Port, without the luscious fruit, and burns the palate.",,80,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mill Creek
US,"Zins hardly get much bigger or bolder than this one. With very high alcohol, it's dry and full bodied, with a glyceriney mouthfeel to the blackberries, cola, mocha and peppery spices. Drink now.",Reserve West Dry Creek,87,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco

US,"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin.",Home Ranch,86,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sbragia
US,"Semi-sweet, this wine combines cherry and chocolate flavors with a vegetal, asparagus taste that detracts from the pleasures a dessert wine ought to bring.",Late Harvest,84,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"This is a big, strong Zinfandel, packing a real punch in terms of flavor. It brings blasts of ripe summer blackberry and cherry, with notes of anise, nettle, chamomile, white pepper and briar.

US,"This epitomizes Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. It's dry, briary and brambly, with wild berry, cola and crisped bacon flavors. It's incredibly spicy, offering everything from black and white pepper to nutmeg, anise and clove. The texture is a delight—silky and gently tannic. While the official alcohol is 13.7%, it tastes warmer.",,90,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"Very good Dry Creek Zin, robust and dry and spicy. Really gets the tastebuds watering, with its tart flavors of sour cherry candy, red currants, blueberries, tart raisins and oodles of peppery spices. Drink this lusty wine with barbecue.",,89,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rued

Dry and rich in tannins, it has waves of blackberries, black currants, herbs, violets and smoky cedar, and is reminiscent of a good Bordeaux.",All Boys,89,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forth
US,"Similar to the 2009 vintage, which was another cool year, this single-vineyard offering is bone dry and strong in tannins, with a complex austerity. It shows tobacco, balsam and tamari notes alongside hints of raspberry and blackberry. It needs rich, complex meat stews or pasta dishes with tomato, garlic and lots of cheese in order to balance the wine's tannins and acids, and to coax out the sweetness.",Florence Vineyard,90,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"With small amounts of Carignane and Petite Sirah, this hails from the winery's estate vineyard in Dry Creek Valley, one of the great sources of Zinfandel in California. It is a very fine Zin, showing near perfect balance.

It's delicious and heady.",West Dry Creek,88,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco

US,"The aroma is all caramelized wood and the dominant flavor is buttered toast and caramel. Wood tannins also come into play, adding to the grape tannins to make for a tough mouthfeel. Somewhere in there is a pretty good Syrah with blackberry flavors. Decanting helps a little, but the oak may never integrate.",Block 9,86,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Terlato

US,"The tannins are quite hard and dry, giving an astringency to this young Cab, but it's so rich in fruit, so long in the finish, that it will make a great partner with certain rich foods, especially lamb and grilled steak. There's a deep core of ripe blackberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate and pepper deep down inside this complex wine. Should develop through 2010.",,90,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard

US,"This is always a drily tannic wine in its youth, but it's also one of the most ambitious Cabs produced from Dry Creek Valley, and is worth attention. With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them. Drink this Cabernet Sauvignon now with very upscale foods, and it should hold and soften for a decade.",Endeavor,93,55,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Spicy and exuberant, if not particularly subtle, a big, juicy wine to drink with steaks and roasts. Bone dry, and pretty tough in tannins, it has flavors of blackberries, leather, cola, coffee and pepper. Ready now.",,86,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Terlato
US,"A good, lusty Zinfandel to toss back with excellent barbecue and roasts. It's a big, full-bodied, fruity wine, packed with dry, tannicly Zinny flavors of wild berries, beef jerky and crushed black pepper. Drink now.",Tori Vineyard,87,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"This dry, spicy wine shows the rustic, rugged quality that often accompanies Dry Creek Cabs. It has the briary texture of a Zinfandel, but with Cabernet's classic blackberry and black currant profile. Drink now–2012.",Rebecca's Vineyard,87,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forth
US,"The sulfur in my bottle was slow to blow off, and when it did, it revealed a toughly tannic, herbal wine. The tastes range from sage and tobacco to candied Life Saver blackberry and cherry to shriveled currants. Those pesky tannins turn up when you swallow, leaving behind a hard astringency.",,83,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hawley
US,"Exotic Indian spices and very ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors characterize this rich, heady wine. It's so fruity that it tastes sweet, but it's actually dry, with a long, delicious finish.",Quinn Vineyard,89,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ulises Valdez

US,"This wine might be the poster child for the raging debate over high alcohol. With 15.7%, it certainly qualifies in that category. But it's also quite good, and has its place. It is dry and exuberant, with cherry, plum, currant and spice flavors, and as heady as it is, it will be fantastic with barbecue.",Teldeschi Vineyard Old Vine,88,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Eno

Drink now.",Three Vineyards,87,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pedroncelli
US,"Here's a wine that's tough and astringent, lacking the generosity you expect from a red wine, especially Merlot. The weedy flavors include a trace of cherry, and the tannins are dry and hard.",Home Ranch,82,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sbragia
US,"A sound, pleasant Zinfandel with a good array of wild berry, cherry, anise, herb and white pepper flavors. The flavors are quite complex, but the wine is a little sharp and edgy in tannins, with some green notes.",St. Peter's Church Selection,85,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Musetta
US,"Sweet, but not very, and lacks the rich opulence you want in a dessert red wine. Shows plenty of raspberry and cherry flavor, but would benefit from greater intensity and sweetness.",Late Harvest,85,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Primitivo,Collier Falls
US,"With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style.",Maple,86,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Produced from the Sierra Foothills winery, Shenandoah, this is a dry, briary and rustic Cabernet. It has wild berry, currant and black pepper flavors, with edgy tannins. Needs rich beef and cheese dishes for balanced food pairing.",,86,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nobos
US,"The age of this wine, nearly 5 years, makes you wonder why Hawley held it back so long. Maybe to let the harshness resolve. If so, it didn't work. It remains a bitter wine, with overripe, Porty flavors.",,80,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Hawley
US,"A good Zin, if a little rugged in tannins, with briary, wild blackberry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors that finish dry and tannic.

A dramatic wine that calls for dramatic food.",Beeson Ranch,94,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Feels hot and tastes sweet, putting it at the rustic end of the Zinfandel spectrum. The official alcohol is 15.3%. At that level, of course, you also get enormously ripe berry flavors. Drink it with barbecue or meat stews.",Mounts Vineyard,85,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
US,"When Dry Creek gets it right, few wineries anywhere can beat their Zins. Somers Ranch is in the eastern hills, where it gets the full benefit of the afternoon sun.

US,"Dashe always produces dependably good Zinfandels from this vineyard. The 2009 shows real complexity, with an earthy, mushroomy richness alongside the raspberry, red currant and spice flavors. It's very dry, with a fine structure of acid and tannins. Marked by the rusticity that characterizes Dry Creek Zinfandels. It calls for pairing with rich stews, braised meats and barbecue.",Louvau Vineyard Old Vines,88,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars

US,"The problem with this wine is excessive alcohol. Officially, it's 16.5%, which is almost Port. However, this Zin is dry. Yet it can't outrun the taste of overripe raisins. Not for everyone, but a decent example of its style.",Red Rooster Old Vine,84,29,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Truett Hurst
US,"Fire up the barbie and load it up. This lusty wine will stand up to grilled stuff, no matter how rich the BBQ sauce. The jammy berry and spice flavors are kicked up with firm tannins and just a touch of sweetness.",,87,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,C5
US,"Shows off the reasons why Dry Creek has achieved a good reputation for this finicky variety, Merlot. The wine isn't made big, gooey Napa-style. Instead, there's an herbal earthiness to the cherry-berry fruit, and the dry tannins suggest pairing with rich fare.",Reserve,87,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Frei Brothers
US,"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.",Corner Pocket Vineyard,90,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Mill Creek

US,"Fritz has made tremendous progress with Cab over the years, and their '05 represents an exciting new step. It's true to the variety, a smoothly dry, tannic wine that brims with currants, cherries and cocoa. Yet it showcases the brambly, briary, peppery notes you find in the best Dry Creek Valley Cabs.",,91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fritz
US,"Syrah and Dry Creek Valley have long been good partners, and this dry, rich wine shows why. It's firm in tannins, but they're finely ground, giving the wine a nice grit to play against fine grilled beef or lamb. The flavors are textbook, suggesting black currants, black raspberries, violets, anisette and dark chocolate.",,91,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Tamayo Family

Great with a charbroiled steak or burgers.",Estate,88,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Primitivo,Collier Falls

US,"An impressive Zinfandel, notable for its complexity and charm. Exudes quintessential Zin character, with a mouthburst of red currants, black raspberry pie filling, wild cherries, sweet charred oak and masses of freshly crushed black pepper. There's even a chocolaty richness in the finish. Production of 921 cases is decent in the old-vine Zin category.",Old Vine Estate,95,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Zichichi Family Vineyard
US,"A beautiful massive, mouthfilling Zinfandel. Impresses on every level, from the smooth, rich tannins to the dryness and above all the depth and range of flavors. Blackberries, chocolate, anise, bacon, pepper, sandalwood, the list goes on. Zinfandel doesn't get much richer than this.

US,"Everything's nice about this dessert wine except for the thinness of flavor. It's honey-sweet, with firm tannins and a bracing jolt of warming alcohol, with sweet caramelization from wood. But the fruit is dilute. Needs greater concentration.",Orgaz Zinfandel,83,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Port,Optima
US,"The 40% new French oak dominates right now, releasing refined aromas of char, cedar, cigar box and vanilla. Below that are profoundly ripe scents of cassis, black currants, mocha, herbs and minerals. Quite dry and tannic, but so powerful are the flavors and so balanced is the wine that it should easily negotiate the next 10 years. Decant now and serve with roasts, grills.",T.R. Passalacqua Vineyard,92,48,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Owl Ridge
US,"The underlying fruit smacks of lemon curd, peach pie and kumquats, with a keen, cold minerality. Well-charred oak and lees contribute the richest notes of butterscotch, vanilla and toast. Dry, crisp and elegant, this is one of the best Dry Creek Valley Chards I've ever tasted, but it's still not in the league of the best cool-climate bottlings.",Home Ranch,92,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sbragia
US,"Here's a big, thick, full-bodied and extracted wine that captures the essence of Dry Creek Valley Zin. Its marked by extremely briary, brambly flavors of wild blue and black berries and cola. Then the spices kick in, starting with black pepper, ranging through cinnamon and star anise, and then finishing with black pepper.

US,"Hard to believe this Sauvignon Blanc never saw oak, because it has a vanilla bean flavor that must come from the grapes alone, although lees aging surely contributes to the creaminess. The underlying flavors are complex, ranging from Meyer lemons and sweet limes to exotic tropical quince, kiwi and guava and just a touch of gooseberry. Best of all is the acidity, which brightens everything. A great Dry Creek Sauvignon Blanc.",,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Stephen & Walker
US,"The grapes got a little too ripe, getting away from the winemaker's control. There's lots of deliciousness, but that supermature edge of raisins, excessive softness and touch of Port make the wine unbalanced, despite the excellence of its vineyard sources.",Cuneo & Saini Vineyards,85,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"A beautiful Zinfandel, and quite a bit better than the '06. Shows great concentration of varietal flavors of briary, freshly picked wild black, blue and red berries, bacon, cola and black pepper, with a sweetness from high alcohol that actually works in the wine's favor. Drink now with very rich grilled meats, stews and hard cheeses.",Estate,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Zichichi Family Vineyard
US,"An interesting Syrah and quite a good one despite some youthful vigor. The tannins are aggressive and accentuate the acidity, making the wine feel tough in the mouth. But it's extraordinarily rich. Floods the palate with intensely ripe blackberries and blueberries, with cool-climate notes of black pepper. Give it a good decant before serving.",Reserve,92,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Montemaggiore
US,"This is a tannic, full-bodied Syrah, and while it's not an ager, it's quite delicious now because of the well-ripened Syrah flavors that Dry Creek does so well.

US,"Perhaps the quintessential Dry Creek Cabernet. There's a Zin-like briary, brambly feeling, and the blackberries have a strong herbal component, while the finish is awash in peppery spices. The tannins, too, are classic Dry Creek, furry and edgy. A lovely, well-structured wine that's the opposite of the modern Napa style.",T.R. Passalacqua Vineyard,90,42,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Passalacqua
US,"Enormously rich and ripe, a dense, deeply flavored wine bursting with blackberry marmalade, chocolate, black currants and black pepper, with a meaty, smoky edge.

Shows luscious waves of ripe forest blackberries, raspberries, red plums and nectarines, with notes of dry chocolate, sweet tobacco, balsam and cedar, finished with massive peppery spices. Notable for the purity and elegance of its tannin-acid structure, this beautiful Zinfandel should age well through 2014.",Bradford Mountain Vineyards,94,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gary Farrell
US,"Good for Fritz for holding this Cab back for a few years to let it mellow. It's still a pretty tannic, primary fruit-laden Cabernet, with briary blackberry, cherry, raspberry and red currant flavors. But judging by the firm tannins, it has an interesting future. Fine now, and should provide good drinking through 2012, at least.",,90,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fritz
US,"Few Cabs smell more inviting, with come-hither scents of wild blackberries, freshly brewed coffee, raspberry pie and toasted vanilla cream.

US,"In a good vintage, which '05 was, Dashe's Dry Creek Zin defines the appellation's style. Very dry, tannic and acidic, the wine offers a rich array of wild blackberries and cherries, peppery spices, and earthy, savory notes of tabasco, root beer, sautéed Portobellos splashed with balsamic vinegar and espresso. Will develop over the next five years.",,89,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars

US,"With massive fruit and power, this low production (300 case) Zinfandel will make lovers of the Shelton style exult, while others might find it lacking elegance.

US,"You might mistake this for a good Dry Creek Zinfandel, it's so briary, brambly and peppery. The fruit is all about red cherries and rec currants, pure and refined, wrapped into dusty tannins. A nice, dry, full-bodied red wine.",,90,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Mounts
US,"Easy to like for its clean, dry purity, and the complicated flavors of black currants, blackberry jam, pepper and cedar. There's a firmness of tannins and acidity that make the structure especially attractive. Drink now.",,90,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mounts
US,"Very peppery and briary, with a slightly green, minty edge to the riper wild berries and tobacco. A good, gutsy Zinfandel of character and a sense of place.",Estate Grown,87,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Fritz
US,"Good tropical fruit, green apple and buttercream flavors in this bone-dry wine. It has a slightly rugged, earthy taste as well, of dried herbs and tobacco. A sound Chardonnay.",Smith Ranch,87,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hawley
US,"There's some sharpness throughout this Zinfandel. The palate wishes it were smoother and more harmonious, especially since the flavors are very rich, suggesting ripe blackberries and blueberries, picked under a warm summer sun, as well as black pepper and mocha. Ready now.",Three Goose,87,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alderbrook
US,"This is a tough, dry wine that needs rich fare to balance it out. It's very tannic and sharp in acidity, with flavors of coffee, blackberries, dark unsweetened chocolate and spices. Should develop well for many years, gradually mellowing and sweetening.",,87,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Unti
US,"The official alcohol on this wine is 14.9%, but it has a syrupy concentration and heat that tastes far higher than that. Was it watered down? Tastes like cherry and blackberry wine that was reduced for a sauce, with a thick, balsamic finish.",Rocking Z Vineyard,83,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Shippey
US,"Last year's bottling was a hard act to follow, but Mauritson's done it again. The vintage was cooler and this wine seems crisper and zestier but no less flavorful, bursting at the seams with ripe lemon, lime, peach and wildflower flavors. Turns as rich as honey on the finish, but it's a dry wine.",,90,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Mauritson
US,"Beautiful Zin, lush and decadent and heady. Hits you with the most wonderfully ripe chocolate, blackberry and cherry marmalade, licorice and spice flavors that are so rich, they would be gooey without the balancing acids and tannins. Drink this wine with the richest possible fare, like short ribs of beef.",Tre Torrente Vineyard,90,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Armida
US,"Very high alcohol in this superripe wine shows in a hot, chili pepper feeling and in the impression of sweetness. Both combine to give the berry-cherry flavors a rustic quality.",Private Reserve,83,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Collier Falls
US,"Here's a well-behaved young Zin, dry and fruity, with firm tannins and acids that will cut through barbecue. The cherry, blackberry, cola and peppery pomegranate flavors will play beautifully against a rich, savory barbecue sauce.",Beeson Ranch,89,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"They say the vines are 68 years old, and they certainly produced a dense, concentrated young Zin. It's like the liquid essence of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, enriched with a dusting of cinnamon, cocoa, coffee and nutmeg. The finish is completely dry. One problem: acidity is very low, making the wine soft and a little medicinal.",Louvau Vineyard Old Vines,86,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"Deliciously showcases the variety in a pure, classic way, while retaining the elegant balance of a light Pinot. With its silky mouthfeel, the complex flavors are all Zin, showing wild berries, gingersnap cookie, cocoa and vanilla, and a rich array of pepper, cinnamon and other spices. Great job from this second label of Martin Ray.",,90,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Courtney Benham
US,"This is a robust, ripe and fruity Zinfandel that impresses for the sheer exuberance of its flavors. They range from black cherries and red currants to cola, chocolate, black pepper and the sweet, glyceriney taste of high alcohol.",,87,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Stephen & Walker
US,"This big, thick, oaky Zinfandel is powerful in flavor and not particularly subtle. It overwhelms with truckloads of blackberry and cherry jam, stewed plums, chocolate, mocha, pepper and cedar, and stings the palate with hard, astringent tannins and heat. The suggestion is ageability, but it's a gamble beyond 2012.",Barrel 32 Lily Hill Estate,87,48,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"This is a big, ripe, rich Merlot, made in the modern style of fruity extraction. Cherries, red currants, red plums and vanilla-infused oak mingle together, leading to a spicy, dry finish. Now–2012.",Hawley Vineyard,87,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Hawley
US,"With ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, the fruit of this dry wine stands out, making it enjoyable despite very tough tannins that currently make it astringently sandpapery. A good effort, although the challenge for Unti is to tame those fierce tannins.",,87,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Unti
US,"This is a huge Cabernet, very soft in the modern manner, and very ripe. It's a blast of cherry jam and milk chocolate, with plenty of toasty oak, and the tannins are firm and complex. Good now, it should hold well for the next ten years.",Endeavor,89,55,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Awkwardly tannic and medicinal, this has tough flavors of blackberry and cherry cough lozenge.",Hillside Estate,81,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Collier Falls
US,"Here's a Zin that gives Zinfanatics plenty of pleasure. Dry Creek Valley brings harmony to this difficult variety, and while the wine retains Zin's briary, wild profile, it retains a dry balance. Enjoy it now for its flashy, youthful fruit.",Estate,87,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Everett Ridge
US,"Tasted alongside the winery's DCV3 bottling, this one's considerably more focused in fruit, altogether a more interesting wine. It's also much higher in alcohol. The wine shows polished Meyer lemon, sweet green grass and vanilla flavors, and although it has no oak, it tastes like it does.",Taylor's Vineyard Musqué,88,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"This Zin is so soft, so ripe, so dessert-like, it could come from Paso Robles, Lodi or any other hot climate. Shows honeyed flavors of black cherry preserves, root beer and milk chocolate, with deficient acidity and tannins. Needs greater structure, which the '05 vintage may bring.",Gino's Vineyard,85,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sbragia
US,"If you want to understand the essence of Dry Creek Valley Zinfandal, taste this wine. It's absolutely classic. Shows the region's balance, power and elegance. From the wild blackberry, raspberry, fig and tangerine zest fruit, to the clove, white pepper and anise spices, to the fabulously rich tannic structure, this is great, world-class Zinfandel. The high alcohol feels absolutely natural.",Lily Hill Estate,94,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"One of the best Bordeaux-style reds in memory from this warm Sonoma County appellation, this blend of all 5 Bordeaux varieties shows wild berry, plum, olive tapenade, spice and dried herb flavors, with tough, slightly rustic tannins that need time to melt. Give it until 2009, and should provide pleasure for another 5 or 6 years.",The Mariner,93,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Here's a Syrah that marches to the beat of its own drummer. Eschewing massive fruit, it shows a subtle, complex mélange of dried blackberries and bitter black cherries, olive tapenade, tobacco, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather and the white pepper of a fine Syrah. Drink this dramatic wine now and through 2011.",Frank Johnson Vineyard,93,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Roshambo
US,"The big acidity on this wine and the citrus fruit flavors make it kind of austere and minerally. But partial new oak and sur lie aging add some richness. This is a very dry, elegant, structural Chard meant for food. Try with a firm white fish topped with a fruity salsa.",Handley Vineyard,87,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Handley
US,"Absolutely easy to drink, a soft, silky wine with pleasantly ripe berry and cherry flavors. Has a rich Asian spiciness throughout, and is dry and balanced.",,84,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Foppiano
US,"Solidy rustic, the kind of country wine you fall in love with at that B&B;, then discover it's not as good as when you drank it gazing over the vineyard. Dry, earthy-fruity and acidic.",,84,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Henehan Hills
US,"Dry Creek Valley seems to coax a wild, feral quality from Sauvignon Blanc. Gooseberries, nettles, fresh green thyme and dandelion greens all give a rich earthiness to the usual citrus, fig and melon flavors. Acidity in this wine is high, too, giving it a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Very nice, at a great price.",,87,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Trentadue
US,"Simple and direct, with cherry-berry and new oak flavors that have an edge of rosemary and thyme. My chief complaint is the apparent sweetness.",Home Ranch,84,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sbragia
US,"This wine doesn't miss not having any oak, because the flavors are rich enough on their own. Backed up with crisp acidity, it offers a wealth of Meyer lemons, pineapples, ripe pears, peaches, lemongrass and spices. Try with a salad of bitter greens, shallots, grapefruit and garlic shrimp.",,88,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rued
US,"Picture-perfect Dry Creek Valley Zin. So lush, so delicious, you just can't get enough. Power-packed with cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate, licorice, tobacco, oak and spice flavors, the wine's structure is beautiful, with elegant tannins and brisk acids.",The Reverend,92,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Roshambo
US,"A good, sound Zinfandel, although a bit too high in alcohol and soft in structure. But it has pretty flavors of cherries, blackberry cobbler, mocha and pepper, and will happily wash down a nice steak.",Somers Ranch,88,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Once again, this bottling delivers a big, lush, complex and succulent young wine for Zin specialist Bella. Marked by extraordinary spices, the wine, with a little Petite Sirah, has powerful wild blackberry and raspberry, olive tapenade, cola and carob flavors that finish with a classic Zin briary, brambly character.",Belle Canyon,91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella

US,"Slightly sweet but crisp in acids, this pleasant wine features citrus, fig, tobacco and vanilla flavors.",,84,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Alderbrook
US,"Quivira produces interesting, often compelling red wines year after year. A Rhône pioneer, their '05 Grenache is far more subtle and elegant than most California bottlings. The powerful red cherry fruit has a spicy edge, while the tannic structure is ripe and layered. A polished wine.",Wine Creek Ranch,91,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Grenache,Quivira
US,"No matter how hard you try to tame Petite Sirah and make it civilized, it retains its feral, rustic nature, which is what makes it such an interesting wine in the right hands. Quivira has “claretized” this wine, yoking the intense cassis, currant, cocoa, gamy leather and pepper flavors to finely ground tannins and a modest alcohol level. But it's still a quintessentially wild Petite Sirah. Drink now through 2017.",Wine Creek Ranch,91,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Quivira
US,"The outlines of a great Dry Creek Zin are here in the fleshy texture, polished tannins and ripe, briary flavors of wild red raspberries, cherries and blueberries. The problem is a certain sweet, glyceriney harshness that comes from very high alcohol, courtesy of the extreme vintage conditions.",,86,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mauritson
US,"Big in flavor, with blackcurrant, cherry pie and cocoa flavors that finish with a bit of raisiny Port. Yet the wine is fully dry, and appeals for its classically elegant tannic structure. Drink now.",,87,42,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Big Fish
US,"Shows Zin's wild, brambly side, with spicy flavors of red and black berries you find in a forest on a hot summer day. Oak adds smoke and vanilla notes to this delicious, richly tannic wine.",Anderson Ranch,90,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"Very soft to the point of melted, this gentle wine has chocolate, blackberry pie, cherry jam and smoky flavors that are fundamentally dry, but finish with an almost liqueur-like sweetness. Good with everything from a smoky charbroiled steak to vanilla ice cream.",,86,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merriam
US,"There's an acidic tartness to this wine that's just perfect to balance the slightly sweet flavors. The figs, citrus, melons and peaches are so ripe, they need that burst of crispness, which cleanses and stimulates the palate for food.",,85,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Lake Sonoma
US,"You'll find exotic flavors in this ripe wine, from the usual blackberries and cherries to espresso, anise and baked pie crust. It's soft and voluptuous, but quite sweet, almost off-dry, which lowers the score.",,85,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Waugh Cellars
US,"A wonderful blush wine that does what rosé is supposed to do. Stimulates the palate with mouthwateringly crisp citrus, red cherry, raspberry, vanilla and spice flavors. So easy to drink, it's one of the better rosés out there.",Wine Creek Ranch Grenache,89,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Quivira
US,"Strikes a nice balance of its parts, although it can't quite overcome its rustic nature. Dry and quite tannic, this Zin shows berry flavors with overtones of earth, coffee and tobacco.",Angeline,84,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Martin Ray
US,"Classic Sauvignon Blanc, dry and racy, with high, mouthwatering acidity framing ripe citrus, melon, fig, vanilla and peppery spice flavors. Finishes long in ripe citrus fruit.",,85,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Lake Sonoma
US,"Opens with pretty strong notes of freshly ground white pepper, but turns lusciously fruity in the mouth, with cherry-berry flavors. The tannins are gritty and firm, leaving a dry, slightly scouring finish. A rack of lamb would be the perfect accompaniment.",,87,29,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longfellow
US,"Oaky and appealing, with blackberry, currant, chocolate and oaky flavors that finish in a swirl of peppery spice. This dry wine was blended with a bit of Syrah and Petite Sirah.",,87,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mounts
US,"After a couple of off years, this bottling is back on form. The Porty edge is gone, and in its place is a gorgeously ripe wine with full control over the fruit. Raspberries, cherries, cassis, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, cocoa, gingerbread, cola, vanilla, Asian spice; the list goes on and on. Meanwhile the mouthfeel is pure velvet, the finish long-lasting. This is Dry Creek Valley Zin at its best.",Somers Ranch,93,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Rather underripe, with herbal aromas and flavors beside riper notes of blackberries, and dry, green tannins. There are some pretty flavors, but they drink semi-sweet, and finish short and simple.",Carl's Vineyard,84,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"Nice and lush, one of the easier Grenaches on the market. It's soft and silky, with ripe flavors of cherries, mocha and spices. A touch (10% new) of oak adds just the right touch of smoke.",Wine Creek Ranch,88,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Grenache,Quivira
US,"A rich, elegant Zin. It's powerful in cherry, blackberry, cola, fig, spice and vanilla flavors, with a silky texture and polished finish.",Wine Creek Ranch,89,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"Seems hollow and watery, especially compared to recent vintages. The '01 scored 90 points. Is this because of the intense heat of the vintage? Whatever, the wine is citrusy and spicy, but you wish it was more intense.",DCV3 Estate,84,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Harsh in texture, this Port-style wine has strong flavors of mocha and sweet blackberry and cherry marmalade. As attractively sweet as it is, there's a sharp roughness that detracts.",Late Harvest,83,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Far simpler, less ripe and altogether less pleasing than Forth's '02 Cab, also just released, this is an earthy, thin wine. Alcohol is the main feature.",All Boys,82,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forth
US,"There's a savage quality to this Syrah, suggesting fresh wild berries growing in fields of lavender, rosemary and pepper tree, and something animal, like roasted meat bone. Under all that it erupts with intense cherry and blackberry fruit, and the sizable tannins make for a puckery feeling. This is quite an interesting Syrah that will gain in complexity over the next five years.",Benediction,91,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek
US,"Nicely brisk and clean in acidity, this racy wine whisks through and cleanses the palate. Along the way, it leaves bright flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits, orange blossom and honeysuckle, with a slightly tart touch of gooseberry. A very nice, unoaked wine.",Fig Tree Vineyard,88,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Quivira
US,"Tastes a bit rough and ready, with a Porty edge, although the wine is dry and the official numbers record only moderate alcohol. There's also high acidity that seems out of place for such a ripe wine.",Somers Ranch,83,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Finally, a Zin that bursts with ripe, rich fruit, but isn't high in alcohol or sugary sweet. After the assault of raspberry and cherry-pie filling, cola, cocoa and spice flavors, the wine shows a balance of acids and tannins that's Bordeaux-like in elegance. Drink now.",Beeson Ranch,90,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Some nice berry flavors, but the wine feels gritty and awkward in the mouth, with sharp tannins and acidity. The finish is tart, almost sour.",,83,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Everett Ridge
US,"Briary and peppery, with fresh, jammy flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, accented with crisp acidity. You'll find some sandpapery tannins and notes of raisins in the finish of this lusty Zin.",,87,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Matrix
US,"Don't be scared by descriptors such as blood, raw meat and leather. It's the best way to suggest the exotic aromas and flavors of this rich, dry wine. You'll also find more familiar elements like cherries and red currants. It's an elegant, smooth sipper that's at its best now and through 2010.",Le Petite Morte,88,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Roshambo
US,"A chewy wine with tremendous extraction and flavor intensity, this has some Port-like qualities, and the flavors are tart-sweet, pruney, with nutty, almost bitter almond notes peeking through. Still young, it will be better in two years. Coses with a big, tooth-staining finish.",Chiotti Vineyard,88,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Good Zinny flavors in this wine, ranging from ripe blackberries and chocolate-covered mint candy to black pepper. A bit too fruity-sweet and simple in structure, but a nice wine for backyard summer sipping.",Reserve,87,48,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Leonhardt
US,"Shows good, Zinny flavors of berries, pepper, leather and tobacco, with riper notes of currants and even hints of raisins. Could be firmer in structure, but it's dry, and not too high in alcohol. Drink now.",Old Vine,87,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Puccioni
US,"There's a peppery heat to this wine from high alcohol, but if you can get past that you'll find a dry, fruity Zin. Rich in spicy wild berry flavors, and turns slightly Porty and raisiny on the finish.",Maple Vineyard Bill's Block,86,49,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutcher Crossing
US,"Quivira's basic '05 Zin is a polished, attractive wine, dry and rich in cherries, raspberries, vanilla and dusty spices. It has a silky texture, and will go well with grilled meats and poultry and hard cheeses.",,87,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"The fruit got very ripe this year in the vineyard, so the flavors are appealing, suggesting chocolate-covered cherry candies with caramel-nougat and red licorice. Fortunately the wine is dry and sturdy in tannins. Balanced enough for mid-term aging, it should remain interesting for 5 or 6 years.",Unti Vineyard,87,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Olson Ogden
US,"Dry and high-alcohol voluptuous, with appealingly forward cherry, blackberry and cola flavors, and a complex, spicy finish. The rich tannins make it perfect with flank steak and short ribs.",Lot 43,87,12,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cameron Hughes

US,"Maybe it's high alcohol, maybe it's residual sugar, but this wine tastes too sweet. The blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors are actually delicious and layered, but the sugariness makes it simple.",Ellie's Vineyard,84,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Wilson
US,"This Cab is dry and tart in acids. It shows polished blackberry jam, coffee and cocoa flavors, finishing with spicy licorice and Hoisin sauce. A good expression of Dry Creek Valley Cabernet. Drink now.",,88,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Harvest Moon
US,"A bit raw and rustic in texture, with a briary, green peppercorn mouthfeel that's scoury and tart in acids. Couple that with berry-cherry fruit, and you can a Zin that tastes sweet-and-sour. But it's very Zinny, and will wash down barbecue with ease.",,84,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bonneau
US,"Lots of creamy milk chocolate, raspberry, cherry and cassis flavors in this wine,but with 16.2% alcohol, it's really more like a fortified, sweet wine.",Diane's Vineyard,83,48,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"Okay for everyday drinking, with crisp acidity and a clean, steely minerality undergirding the lime flavors. The drawback is a strong feline smell and taste that some will find offensive.",East Side Vineyards,83,12,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Pedroncelli
US,"The problem is the high 16.2% alcohol that makes the wine hot, Porty and sweet.",Carl's Vineyard,82,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson

Dry, crisp and wonderfully flavorful, with oodles of tropical fruit, wildflower and, most of all, oriental herbs and spice flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and lemongrass. Just a really nice California Gewurz.",Estate,86,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Mill Creek
US,"Take a Dry Creek Cabernet, give it a more robust body, a more rustic mouthfeel, and push the flavors toward plums and leather, and you get this old-style wine. The dry, rasping tannins suggest aging for at least eight years.",,86,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Pedroncelli
US,"A very nice Cabernet at a fair price. It's a smooth wine with a good grip of tannins framing currant, herb and smoky oak flavors. Finishes with real complexity and elegance.",Three Vineyards,86,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pedroncelli
US,"If you had to choose one Zinfandel to showcase Dry Creek Valley, it's this one. The vines are said to be over 100 years of age. Just superb. Has the balance and depth of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, but with Zin's spicy, briary, brambly personality. Erupts in wild berry, currant, cola, leather, mocha and peppery spice flavors that are so rich and deep and long-lasting. Pricey, but sets a benchmark for Zinfandel. Only 550 cases were produced.",Buchignani-Garcia Vineyard Old Vine Reserve,95,60,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Deerfield

US,"Fritz has a good track record with Dry Creek Valley Zin, one of the variety's best natural homes in California. This is their most expensive bottling in years, and it's quite good. Rich and savory, with fine, ripe tannins, it shows flavors of raspberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and Asian spices, with a meaty, leathery edge. Best now and for the next several years.",Barrel Select Estate Reserve,91,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Fritz
US,"Even at four-plus years, this interesting Syrah needs a little more time to show its best because, while it's very good now, it's tight in tannins that shut the palate down. Decanting will help, and so will big, rich foods such as duck and lamb. But the cherry, blackberry, white pepper and sweet leather flavors will blossom after 2008, and the wine should hold and improve through 2011.",La Rousse,91,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Forth

US,"This drily elegant Zin needs food to perk it up, especially lighter meats, like veal, pork or chicken. It's not full-bodied enough for beef, with flavors of cherries and tobacco that are almost Pinot-esque in their silky texture. Good value for its complexity.",Mother Clone,87,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pedroncelli
US,"Shows the lusty, rustic nature of Dry Creek Zins.

US,"Lots of rich, extracted blackberry, cherry and currant flavors in this wine, with nuances of sweet, smoky oak and considerable spices, especially toward the finish.

In the wrong hands these low-yielding grapes might have been mishandled, but Dry Creek Vineyard knows Zinfandel. The result is superb, spectacular, the essence of old vine Sonoma.

Exudes quintessential Zin character, with a mouthburst of red currants, black raspberry pie filling, wild cherries, sweet charred oak and masses of freshly crushed black pepper. There's even a chocolaty richness in the finish. Production of 921 cases is decent in the old-vine Zin category.",Old Vine Estate,95,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Zichichi Family Vineyard
US,"A beautiful massive, mouthfilling Zinfandel. Impresses on every level, from the smooth, rich tannins to the dryness and above all the depth and range of flavors. Blackberries, chocolate, anise, bacon, pepper, sandalwood, the list goes on. Zinfandel doesn't get much richer than this. The alcohol is 15.5%.",Cortina,94,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio

US,"Hard to believe this Sauvignon Blanc never saw oak, because it has a vanilla bean flavor that must come from the grapes alone, although lees aging surely contributes to the creaminess. The underlying flavors are complex, ranging from Meyer lemons and sweet limes to exotic tropical quince, kiwi and guava and just a touch of gooseberry. Best of all is the acidity, which brightens everything. A great Dry Creek Sauvignon Blanc.",,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Stephen & Walker
US,"Kudos to the winery for holding this estate grown wine back for five-plus years.

Drink now with very rich grilled meats, stews and hard cheeses.",Estate,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Zichichi Family Vineyard

Give it a good decant before serving.",Reserve,92,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Montemaggiore

Good now, and should slowly develop in the bottle for years.",The Mariner,92,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Somewhat crude and angular now, but then again, it's Petite Sirah, and mountain-grown at that. Shows considerable tannins and fresh acidity, with compact flavors of wild black and blue berries, licorice, currants and peppery spices, finshed with a flourish of dark chocolate. A very fine wine that needs time. Better after 2012.",Dry Creek Mountain Vineyard,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Gustafson Family

Drink this strongly flavored, dry wine with barbecue or beef-centered Latin fare.",Warm Springs Ranch Reserve,86,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Made in a superripe, high-alcohol style, this Zin may be an acquired taste, but if you like this approach, it's a sensation. Dry, soft and a little hot, it shows massive blackberry tart, black cherry pie, blueberry jam, chocolate, anise, pepper and Indian spice flavors. Almost Port-like, but never loses essential control, and a fine example of Dry Creek.",,92,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gustafson Family
US,"This rich, spicy Zinfandel defines the Dry Creek style. It's fruit-forward in briary, brambly berry and currant flavors that have hints of anise and chocolate, and is dry, with sturdy tannins and a balancing cut of acidity. Very enticing.

Passalacqua Vineyard,90,42,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Passalacqua
US,"Enormously rich and ripe, a dense, deeply flavored wine bursting with blackberry marmalade, chocolate, black currants and black pepper, with a meaty, smoky edge.

US,"Shows a distinguished structure and mouthfeel proving that Dry Creek Cabs are really moving forward. Quite different from Napa in the briary, brambly, wild berry flavors, almost like Zinfandel, and the brisk tannins. This food-friendly wine will perform well on a restaurant wine list.",Estate Grown,91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mounts
US,"Good for Fritz for holding this Cab back for a few years to let it mellow. It's still a pretty tannic, primary fruit-laden Cabernet, with briary blackberry, cherry, raspberry and red currant flavors. But judging by the firm tannins, it has an interesting future.

US,"If you had to choose one Zinfandel to showcase Dry Creek Valley, it's this one. The vines are said to be over 100 years of age. Just superb. Has the balance and depth of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, but with Zin's spicy, briary, brambly personality. Erupts in wild berry, currant, cola, leather, mocha and peppery spice flavors that are so rich and deep and long-lasting. Pricey, but sets a benchmark for Zinfandel.

US,"This rich, fruity Cabernet comes from one of the higher mountain regions in Dry Creek Valley. It's enormously concentrated in blackberry, black currant and oak flavors, with the briary, peppery note so often found in Dry Creek reds. Fairly tannic, it leaves a trail of astringency after you swallow. Good, if a little rustic. Give it three or four years to come around.",Watchtower Vineyard Estate,90,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gustafson Family
US,"Classic Dry Creek Zin. There's a reason this warmish Sonoma region is so famous for Zinfandel, and here it is.

The fruit suggests wild black, blue and red berries. Drink now.",Teldeschi Vineyards Home Ranch Old Vine,92,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Del Carlo Winery
US,"An interesting Cabernet that shows how this venerable winery is taking the variety seriously.

US,"Richness alone would earn this Zinfandel a good score, but the overall balance uplifts it. It's simply delicious in wild berry, spice, mocha, salty bacon, vanilla toast and sandalwood flavors. Yet the tannins are fine, and the acidity is perfect. Even the slightly sweet finish and high alcohol work.",Sawyer Vineyard,90,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson

Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",Pauline's Vineyard,89,37,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Papapietro Perry

They range from black cherries and red currants to cola, chocolate, black pepper and the sweet, glyceriney taste of high alcohol.",,87,39,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Stephen & Walker
US,"This big, thick, oaky Zinfandel is powerful in flavor and not particularly subtle. It overwhelms with truckloads of blackberry and cherry jam, stewed plums, chocolate, mocha, pepper and cedar, and stings the palate with hard, astringent tannins and heat. The suggestion is ageability, but it's a gamble beyond 2012.",Barrel 32 Lily Hill Estate,87,48,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella

US,"There's a rustic feeling in the mouth, as though the tannins aren't fully ripened. That famous Dry Creek spiciness also contributes to the scoury, briary texture. Elaborate oak stands out in stark relief to the blackberries and cherries. The result is somewhat erratic, but could knit together in a few years.",Hawley Vineyard,86,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hawley

With a full-bodied structure, it calls for rich, cheese-finished dishes.",Florence Vineyard,88,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars

US,"This is a big, gutsy, muscular Merlot marked by hard, dry tannins. That doesn't mean it's not rich. It is, in black cherries, black currants, mocha and oak, but it remains a tough, hard wine despite being nearly six years old. Not going anywhere.",Amour,85,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Williamson Wines
US,"Could and should be sweeter than 3.9% residual sugar to justify being a dessert wine. Teases with somewhat sweet blackberry, chocolate and pepper flavors that pull back to a tannic, earthy finish.",Estate Grown Late Harvest,85,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Fritz

US,"Very good Dry Creek Zin, robust and dry and spicy. Really gets the tastebuds watering, with its tart flavors of sour cherry candy, red currants, blueberries, tart raisins and oodles of peppery spices. Drink this lusty wine with barbecue.",,89,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rued
US,"A really good Cabernet that shows elegance and class, and this is a good price for it.

US,"Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age.",Clarissa Vin Rouge,84,47,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Williamson Wines
US,"Although the residual sugar on this dessert Zin is a hefty 9%, it's unbalanced. Doesn't have the fruity concentration it needs, leaving it basically a melange of alcohol and sweetness.",Late Harvest,84,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"Mazzocco's Zins are dependably superripe and high in alcohol. This '07 is a big, strong wine, offering flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam, spread onto buttered white toast and sprinkled with anisette. It's delicious and heady.",West Dry Creek,88,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Somewhat sharp and angular in the mouth, but other than that, a pretty good glass of Syrah. It's dry and ripe in blackberry and cherry compote, mocha-choca, bacon and pepper flavors, leading to a long, spicy finish, and the tannins are pure and wonderful.",Unti Vineyards,87,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Muscardini
US,"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through.",Lily Hill Estate,84,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Bella
US,"Lots of good flavor in this dry wine, with blackberries, black currants and herbs. But it's very hard in tannins, with a drily astringent mouthfeel that no amount of age is likely to mitigate.",Seduce,84,57,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Williamson Wines

US,"An uncomfortable wine. It's not quite ripe, showing green flavors and a strong dose of that notorious feline smell that diminishes the citrus fruits. On the plus side is extreme dryness and crisp acidity.",,82,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hawley
US,"A big, soft, ultrarich style of Zinfandel. It has very high alcohol, with flamboyant flavors of milk chocolate, oozingly ripe blackberries and blueberries, anise liqueur and black pepper. The finish is totally dry. Lusty and heady.",Diane's Reserve,88,60,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",,87,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dogwood

Drink this lusty wine now.",Mountain Cuvée,87,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Gustafson Family

They burst in the mouth, carrying waves of spices and fruity acids through a spicy, slightly hot finish. At its best now.",Perotti Vineyards,87,27,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
US,"What a wonderful wine for the price. It's dry, elegant and classically structured, and while the cherry, herb, tobacco and oak flavors finish a bit short, this Merlot shows lots of appeal. It's a great by the glass pour.",,87,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt

US,"The 16.2% alcohol shows in the Porty aroma and flavor of this unusually ripe Zin. It tastes of cayenne pepper, caramelized blackberry pie filling, milk chocolate and toasted meringue, and even with all that alcohol, it's still a little sweet. You can criticize it for not being a proper, dry table wine, but it's an interesting whatever it is.",Pony,86,27,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco

If you can get past that, the wine is nicely dry and rich in fruit, with cherry, tobacco, spice and oak flavors.",Estate Grown,86,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Mounts
US,"A big, deeply flavored, extraordinarily ripe Syrah, brimming with blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice and black pepper, all of it enhanced with the sweet-smoky taste of oak.

US,"Shows a dramatic interpretation of Dry Creek terroir, with intense wild berry, mocha and spice flavors that are so ripe, they veer into currants and grilled blackberries.

Drink now through 2012.",Bradford Mountain Vineyards,95,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gary Farrell
US,"Bluenose's 2005 Zin is as pretty and polished as Zinfandel gets. The structure is just beautiful, with ripe, firm tannins and fine acidity, while the oak is perfectly integrated. The flavors?

Just lovely, a world-class Zinfandel.",,92,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Nalle
US,"Very dry, this Cabernet comes down on the side of elegance and structure rather than power. It feels firmly tannic in the mouth, offering blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, with an undertow of minerality and a grounding of coffee and herbs.

US,"A massive Zinfandel, super-concentrated and intense, although bone dry, that shows potent tannins that may help it develop.

Could mellow beyond 2012.",Reserve,91,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Nalle

Best now and for the next several years.",Barrel Select Estate Reserve,91,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Fritz
US,"Even at four-plus years, this interesting Syrah needs a little more time to show its best because, while it's very good now, it's tight in tannins that shut the palate down. Decanting will help, and so will big, rich foods such as duck and lamb.

With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet.

Turns as rich as honey on the finish, but it's a dry wine.",,90,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Mauritson
US,"Beautiful Zin, lush and decadent and heady.

US,"This easy-drinking Zinfandel starts off with heady, almost Port-like aromas of berries and spice, then continues that theme on the palate, but with reasonable alcohol levels and moderate body. Chocolate, mixed berry and spice flavors trail away on the finish.",,87,17,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dancing Bear Cellars
US,"Tasted alongside the winery's DCV3 bottling, this one's considerably more focused in fruit, altogether a more interesting wine. It's also much higher in alcohol. The wine shows polished Meyer lemon, sweet green grass and vanilla flavors, and although it has no oak, it tastes like it does.",Taylor's Vineyard Musqué,88,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Shows the lusty, rustic nature of Dry Creek Zins. There's an earthy, herbal component to the brambly blackberry and black raspberry fruit, with a sweet, spicy finish of olive tapenade and roasted figs. Great with sugar-based barbecue sauce on poultry or beef.",,87,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Vin Nostro
US,"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.",Corner Pocket Vineyard,90,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Mill Creek
US,"Cherries of every kind—red, black, jam, pie—are the essence of flavor here, along with red licorice, cola and sandalwood. It's a nice, structurally interesting and bone dry wine, with firm tannins and a good cut of acidity. Ready now.",Conley Vineyard,87,27,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Grenache,Frick
US,"The big acidity on this wine and the citrus fruit flavors make it kind of austere and minerally. But partial new oak and sur lie aging add some richness. This is a very dry, elegant, structural Chard meant for food. Try with a firm white fish topped with a fruity salsa.",Handley Vineyard,87,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Handley
US,"Lake Sonoma produces varietally pure wines at fair prices. This is a solid Zin, rich and spicy, with cherry-berry and cocoa fruit flavors framed in brisk, fine tannins. Will hold for up to six years.",,90,17,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Lake Sonoma
US,"Hard tannins and high acidity make this inky-colored wine hard and distant now, an impression enhanced by extreme dryness. With its blackberry, currant, cocoa, beef jerky and pepper flavors, it's the kind of Petite Sirah that will last for many years, gradually softening and mellowing until it's just an echo of itself around 2020.",,87,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Pedroncelli
US,"A bit sharp and weedy, and very dry, but it's a good, clean wine that trades structure for richness. Strong acids and tannins frame herb-infused flavors of cherries and red currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Drink now.",Owl Hill Vineyard Estate Bottled,87,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Counoise,Frick
US,"They say the vines are 68 years old, and they certainly produced a dense, concentrated young Zin. It's like the liquid essence of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, enriched with a dusting of cinnamon, cocoa, coffee and nutmeg. The finish is completely dry. One problem: acidity is very low, making the wine soft and a little medicinal.",Louvau Vineyard Old Vines,86,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
US,"Dry Creek Valley seems to coax a wild, feral quality from Sauvignon Blanc. Gooseberries, nettles, fresh green thyme and dandelion greens all give a rich earthiness to the usual citrus, fig and melon flavors. Acidity in this wine is high, too, giving it a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Very nice, at a great price.",,87,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Trentadue
US,"Not quite as complex as Fritz's Barrel Select Reserve, a soft, direct wine, with jammy cherry, blackberry, blueberry, tangerine, root beer, licorice, herb and spice flavors that taste a little sweet. Drink now.",Estate,86,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Fritz
US,"With a little Petite Sirah and Carignane added for complexity, this is a beautiful Zinfandel meant for drinking now. It has fresh, zesty flavors of wild raspberries, cherries, blueberries and red currants, with notes of licorice, cocoa and pepper. Notable new oak adds even richer elements of vanilla and smoke.",,90,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ferrari-Carano
US,"A beautiful Zin, made from old vines grown on the superior western side of the valley. While the wine lacks a bit of the concentration of the sensational 2005, it's softly lush and delicious, with an array of wild berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Drink now.",Beeson Ranch,90,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"You might mistake this for a good Dry Creek Zinfandel, it's so briary, brambly and peppery. The fruit is all about red cherries and rec currants, pure and refined, wrapped into dusty tannins. A nice, dry, full-bodied red wine.",,90,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Mounts
US,"Easy to like for its clean, dry purity, and the complicated flavors of black currants, blackberry jam, pepper and cedar. There's a firmness of tannins and acidity that make the structure especially attractive. Drink now.",,90,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mounts
US,"A very nice, dry and balanced Merlot. While it's not particularly varietal, it shows a good profile, with brisk tannins and controlled berry, cherry, currant, herb and spice flavors. Versatile at the table with almost anything that needs a full-bodied red.",Bench Vineyards,87,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Pedroncelli
US,"A good, tannic, dry wine that will pair well with barbecued steak and other meats whose fatty richness will cut through its considerable tannins. Shows deep, spicy flavors of cherries and currants, with a coating of smoky wood. Drink now.",,87,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cinsault,Frick

US,"Bone dry, acidic and minerally, this isn't very Chard-like in terms of richness of fruit. But it's clean and pleasantly sippable, with modest apple and lime flavors.",Vintage Selection,84,12,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pedroncelli
US,"The outlines of a great Dry Creek Zin are here in the fleshy texture, polished tannins and ripe, briary flavors of wild red raspberries, cherries and blueberries. The problem is a certain sweet, glyceriney harshness that comes from very high alcohol, courtesy of the extreme vintage conditions.",,86,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mauritson
US,"This Zin is so soft, so ripe, so dessert-like, it could come from Paso Robles, Lodi or any other hot climate. Shows honeyed flavors of black cherry preserves, root beer and milk chocolate, with deficient acidity and tannins. Needs greater structure, which the '05 vintage may bring.",Gino's Vineyard,85,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sbragia
US,"Pretty much like a good Dry Creek Zinfandel, maybe even spicier. This red wine is medium-bodied, dry and very fruity, with flavors of wild cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate. Great with a charbroiled steak or burgers.",Estate,88,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Primitivo,Collier Falls
US,"Very soft to the point of melted, this gentle wine has chocolate, blackberry pie, cherry jam and smoky flavors that are fundamentally dry, but finish with an almost liqueur-like sweetness. Good with everything from a smoky charbroiled steak to vanilla ice cream.",,86,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merriam
US,"Tastes harsh from entry to finish, with raisin, stewed blackberry and licorice flavors that have a hard edge of acidity. Not going anywhere, so drink up with rich meats and cheeses.",Alto Vineyards,83,12,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Pedroncelli
US,"Classic Sauvignon Blanc, dry and racy, with high, mouthwatering acidity framing ripe citrus, melon, fig, vanilla and peppery spice flavors. Finishes long in ripe citrus fruit.",,85,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Lake Sonoma
US,"A little hot and peppery, but it's Sonoma Zin, and a chunk of grilled beef will be a great match to the heat and tannins. This drily robust wine has flavors of wild berries, cherries, bacon and Asian spices. Drink now.",,89,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
US,"Simple and direct, with cherry-berry and new oak flavors that have an edge of rosemary and thyme. My chief complaint is the apparent sweetness.",Home Ranch,84,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sbragia
US,"Tastes sweet and honeyed in pineapple and lemon Lifesaver candy, with a sharp cut of acidity that tastes almost unnatural. Feels overly manipulated, but will appeal to lots of people.",Gannon Vineyard,85,27,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Frick
US,"This wine doesn't miss not having any oak, because the flavors are rich enough on their own. Backed up with crisp acidity, it offers a wealth of Meyer lemons, pineapples, ripe pears, peaches, lemongrass and spices. Try with a salad of bitter greens, shallots, grapefruit and garlic shrimp.",,88,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rued
US,"Very ripe and jammy, a superfruity young Cab that could benefit from time in the cellar. Erupts in the mouth with blackberries, cherries, licorice, currants and cedar, wrapped into smooth tannins. Give it 2–3 years to mellow.",Smith Orchard Vineyard Reserve,88,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,DeLorimier
US,"A good, sound Zinfandel, although a bit too high in alcohol and soft in structure. But it has pretty flavors of cherries, blackberry cobbler, mocha and pepper, and will happily wash down a nice steak.",Somers Ranch,88,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"A bit too soft and sweet, with candied flavors of black cherries, chocolate and anise biscotti. Certainly offers lots of richness, but could use greater structure.",,85,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dogwood
US,"Seems hollow and watery, especially compared to recent vintages. The '01 scored 90 points. Is this because of the intense heat of the vintage? Whatever, the wine is citrusy and spicy, but you wish it was more intense.",DCV3 Estate,84,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"The first thing to know about this Zinfandel is its extraordinarily high alcohol. The official reading is 16%. It's almost Port, except that it's bone dry. The tannins are hard, and the flavors are of ripe blackberries. Yet it's a good example of its type and deserves a good score.",Ken's Reserve,88,44,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"I discovered Bella a few years ago and was glad to find a Zin specialist with a real commitment to vineyard terroir. Bella's estate has produced a wonderfully dry Zin, as rich and balanced as a classic Cab, with Zin's briary, brambly fruit. This is really one of the best Zins out there right now.",Lily Hill Vineyard,92,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"A rich, savory Zin, brimming with freshly picked flavors of ripe wild red, blue and black berries, cola, sweet kid leather, mocha and tobacco. Fully dry and not too tannic, it's ready to drink now.",,87,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo

US,"Tastes a bit rough and ready, with a Porty edge, although the wine is dry and the official numbers record only moderate alcohol. There's also high acidity that seems out of place for such a ripe wine.",Somers Ranch,83,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Big in flavor, with blackcurrant, cherry pie and cocoa flavors that finish with a bit of raisiny Port. Yet the wine is fully dry, and appeals for its classically elegant tannic structure. Drink now.",,87,42,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Big Fish
US,"Made white Bordeaux-style, with barrel fermentation in partially new French oak and aged sur lies, this vineyard bottling is always interesting, but the '04 is one of the best. It's rich and creamy, with complex flavors of Meyer lemon, ripe fig, honeydew, crushed pineapple and peppery spice. Yet for all that, it's quite dry. Don't overchill, or you'll miss the nuances.",Fig Tree Vineyard,92,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Quivira
US,"This is Zinfandel on steroids, which is the Wilson house style. The wine is dry, full bodied and very high in alcohol, approaching 16%. Yet it's zesty and exuberant, with a wealth of blackberry, currant and pepper flavors. Distinctly Californian and Dry Creek Valley, it's a fine example of its type.",Sawyer Reserve,88,44,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"Still very tannic and heavy at the age of more than five years. It's quite soft in acids, which accentuates the heaviness, and the cherry, herb and tobacco flavors lead to an astringent finish. Not going anywhere.",Owl Hill Vineyard Estate Bottled,84,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frick
US,"A big, heavy, full-bodied and ripe Zinfandel that needs rich, greasy meats and cheeses to tame it. The blackberry, currant and dry chocolate flavors are huge, and the tannins are even bigger, giving this extremely dry wine an astringent finish.",Tori's Reserve,88,44,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
US,"Strongly extracted and oaky, this Cab isn't showing much finesse now. It has jammy, pie-filling blackberry and cherry flavors, liberally spiced and wrapped into chewy tannins. Will age without developing complexity.",Taylor Reserve,87,41,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dutcher Crossing
US,"After a couple of off years, this bottling is back on form. The Porty edge is gone, and in its place is a gorgeously ripe wine with full control over the fruit. Raspberries, cherries, cassis, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, cocoa, gingerbread, cola, vanilla, Asian spice; the list goes on and on. Meanwhile the mouthfeel is pure velvet, the finish long-lasting. This is Dry Creek Valley Zin at its best.",Somers Ranch,93,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard

US,"The heat from high alcohol combines with Zinfandel's natural pepperiness to produce a hot, high decibel mouthfeel. If you can get past that, you'll find rich flavors of berries, currants and cocoa.",Forchini Vineyards Old Vine,84,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
US,"This is quite a sophisticated wine, partially barrel fermented and aged sur lies, which softens and mellows it. The underlying fruit flavors, of citrus, fig, melon and spice, are ripe and juicy in acidity. This is a beautiful accompaniment to grilled shellfish.",,90,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Bugay

US,A common or garden variety Chardonnay whose flamboyant caramelized oak flavors dominate the pineapples and limes.,,82,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bedarra
US,"There's a savage quality to this Syrah, suggesting fresh wild berries growing in fields of lavender, rosemary and pepper tree, and something animal, like roasted meat bone. Under all that it erupts with intense cherry and blackberry fruit, and the sizable tannins make for a puckery feeling. This is quite an interesting Syrah that will gain in complexity over the next five years.",Benediction,91,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek

US,"It's not clear that Dry Creek Valley is the ideal home for Merlot. This winery's bottlings have been good but earthy, tannic and dry in the past. This one represents a step foward. There's something elegant about it, and the cherry and mocha-tinged flavors certainly are pleasurable. Drink now.",,88,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Too high and hot in alcohol, with dry Port flavors of blackberries and dark unsweetened chocolate, and a peppery finish.",Adel's Vineyard,82,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
US,"Finally, a Zin that bursts with ripe, rich fruit, but isn't high in alcohol or sugary sweet.

Drink now.",Beeson Ranch,90,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"A nice Zin made in Mazzocco's bold, ripe style, and since it's as good as their more expensive Zins, a comparative value.

US,"The official alcohol on this wine is 14.9%, but it has a syrupy concentration and heat that tastes far higher than that. Was it watered down?

Rich in spicy wild berry flavors, and turns slightly Porty and raisiny on the finish.",Maple Vineyard Bill's Block,86,49,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutcher Crossing

US,"Here's a wine that deserves its reserve status. It's pure in varietal character, from the briary, white pepper, wild berry and coffee flavors to the sturdy tannins, and that feral edge of friendly aggression that marks a good Zin.

US,"Big, ripe, voluptuous and mouth-filling are just a few of the descriptors that come to mind with this dry, juicy Zin.

US,"No matter how hard you try to tame Petite Sirah and make it civilized, it retains its feral, rustic nature, which is what makes it such an interesting wine in the right hands. Quivira has “claretized” this wine, yoking the intense cassis, currant, cocoa, gamy leather and pepper flavors to finely ground tannins and a modest alcohol level.

US,"Made in the Mazzocco style, this Zin is enormously high in alcohol, namely 16.1%, and is fully dry. Shows a Porty headiness, with berry flavors that veer into chocolate-covered raisins and prunes.",Reserve Pony,84,50,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Imagery continues to bring a full-blown, baroque interpretation to its interesting single-vineyard wines. This Zin is ultraripe, exhibiting chocolate, cherry and coffee flavors, and is soft in tannins. Yet there's a grip and dryness that make it complex.",Taylor Vineyard,90,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Imagery
US,"Young, fresh and jammy, this Syrah might benefit from a year or two in the cellar. It's dry and filled with blueberry, blackberry and cherry flavors, with a cut of dusty tannins. Good now with steak, or hold through 2007.",Justice,87,21,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Roshambo
US,"Released at one year of age, this single-vineyard Zinfandel is too young for enjoyment. It shows hard tannins and tart, candied fruit flavors that have yet to emerge into bottle complexity. Give it until late 2010, and it should provide plenty of berry, cherry and spice enjoyment for a few more years.",Cody's Block Old Vine,88,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Eric Ross
US,"Golden and extracted. Butter-sautéed bananas, intense tangerine and peach and pineapple custard and vanilla are among the flavors. Good acidity, but so sweet and delicious.",,90,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,Rosenblum
US,"Clean, balanced and very drinkable, this Zin shows well-ripened cherry-berry flavors and smooth, rich tannins, and finishes dry. It's an easy, assured wine that shows real Dry Creek character.",The Reverend,86,21,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Roshambo
US,"Here's a nice Cab that's easy to like for its ripe berry, chocolate, olive and herb flavors and rich, smooth texture, yet it has a fancy complexity that will translate to a fine dinner. Drink now for the sheer exuberance of youth.",All Boys,90,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forth
US,"Packed with sweet, fruity flavors of cherries, black raspberries and cocoa, with plenty of spice, this warm-hearted wine is soft but rich in fine, dusty tannins. Picks up more pronounced fruity sweetness on the finish.",Teldeschi,89,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"A really beautiful white wine, really distinctive for its flavors of grassy hay and citrus fruits with richer notes of sweet figs, spicy melons and smoky oak. Quite complex, with a creamy texture, and not overly sweet.",,88,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Lake Sonoma
US,The problem here is excessive sweetness. It tastes like there was a lot of residual sugar in the wine when fermentation was stopped. As a result the flavor is of sugared blackberry tea.,Bradford Mountain Vineyards,80,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gary Farrell
US,"A rich, elegant Zin. It's powerful in cherry, blackberry, cola, fig, spice and vanilla flavors, with a silky texture and polished finish.",Wine Creek Ranch,89,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"This is a Cab-like Zin. It has a nice balance, lush but easy tannins, good acidity and instant credibility, but never loses Zin's woolly, wild, feral quality. Demands rich fare, like beef short ribs.",Beeson Ranch,89,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"This Cabernet-Syrah blend is obviously very ripe, packed with black cherry and chocolate flavors, with interesting herb and pepper notes. There's a nice edge of tan nins and acids. Sophisticated and intricate, it will pair well with lamb or beef.",Superiore,89,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Montemaggiore
US,"There's a lot of sugary sweetness in this wine, which tastes like the blackberry and cherry filling of those pop-up tarts. Fortunately, it has the acidity and tannic richness to balance. But it's not really a table wine. More like dessert.",Carreras Ranch,84,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Manzanita Creek
US,"Strikes a nice balance of its parts, although it can't quite overcome its rustic nature. Dry and quite tannic, this Zin shows berry flavors with overtones of earth, coffee and tobacco.",Angeline,84,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Martin Ray
US,"Don't be scared by descriptors such as blood, raw meat and leather. It's the best way to suggest the exotic aromas and flavors of this rich, dry wine. You'll also find more familiar elements like cherries and red currants. It's an elegant, smooth sipper that's at its best now and through 2010.",Le Petite Morte,88,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Roshambo
US,"I've always been a fan of this wine, which showcases the Dry Creek terroir in an appealing way. Gobs of sweet citrus, fig, melon and spice flavors, with crisp acids and a clean finish.",Handley Vineyard,88,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Handley
US,"Dark and intense in spicy blackberry, cherry, cocoa and earthy flavors with a hint of bitter espresso. The rich but smooth tannins and crisp acidity of this ripe wine cry out for beef or lamb.",,87,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Trentadue
US,"Charming, with a good balance of ripe tree fruits, oak, and earthy, herbal notes. Satisfies your Chardonnay tooth, but it's understated enough not to swamp food",,87,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Alderbrook
US,"They must have held this wine back for five years to let the tannins soften. They have, a little, but it's still a tough, hard-edged wine, with blackcurrant, herb and oak flavors. It's a gamble, but could do interesting things over the next ten years.",Endeavour,86,55,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Hot in alcohol, with sweetened blackberry and raisin flavors. A good example of a Port-like table wine.",Three Vines,83,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Manzanita Creek

US,"Lean, herbal and austerely dry, this Zin offers little in the way of fruit, although it's perfectly clean and decent. If you concentrate, you'll find modest cherry-berry flavors.",Reserve Selection,83,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hayman & Hill
US,"Takes a controlled approach to a variety that is often over the top. You'll find the usual exotic tropical fruit and ripe peach notes, but they're trimmed with sour citrus, and the acidity helps maintain balance. Dry and elegant, this wine defines the possibilities of upscale Viognier.",Block Collection Preston Vineyard,90,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Geyser Peak
US,"The official alcohol is 14.9%, but the wine smells and tastes like a young harsh Port. In the mouth, it has a tight, sweet acid feel, rather medicinal. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",,82,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Quivira's basic '05 Zin is a polished, attractive wine, dry and rich in cherries, raspberries, vanilla and dusty spices. It has a silky texture, and will go well with grilled meats and poultry and hard cheeses.",,87,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Quivira
US,"The fruit got very ripe this year in the vineyard, so the flavors are appealing, suggesting chocolate-covered cherry candies with caramel-nougat and red licorice. Fortunately the wine is dry and sturdy in tannins. Balanced enough for mid-term aging, it should remain interesting for 5 or 6 years.",Unti Vineyard,87,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Olson Ogden
US,"Dry and high-alcohol voluptuous, with appealingly forward cherry, blackberry and cola flavors, and a complex, spicy finish. The rich tannins make it perfect with flank steak and short ribs.",Lot 43,87,12,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cameron Hughes
US,"Swift and clean, a bright, zesty wine with high acidity and modest flavors of citrus fruits, figs and vanilla. There's an appealing creaminess to the texture. Finishes spicy.",,85,13,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Trellis
US,"Very dry, this Cab mixes berry-cherry flavors with herbal ones to produce a wine of angularity and a certain tannic austerity. It's the kind of wine that will play a supporting role at the table, rather than insisting on center stage.",Bradford Mountain,89,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gary Farrell
US,"Dry Creek Valley has a natural affinity for Marsanne, and particularly in this balanced vintage. The grapes got ripe in lemon chiffon, peach and honeysuckle flavors, while a clean crispness and minerality add length and palate interest. Sur lies aging in the barrel brings even richer notes of cream and smoky vanilla. This Marsanne explores the outer reaches of the variety's possibilities in California.",Preston Vineyard,92,32,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,JC Cellars
US,"Opens with a strong aroma of smoked meat and bacon, not bad, but indicative of brettanomyces in the winery. In the mouth are flavors of red and black cherries, with a spicy edge of clove.",Sydney Vineyard,84,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Wilson
US,"Polished and soft in texture, with decent cherry, earth and cocoa flavors. Could use more intensity.",,84,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Alderbrook
US,"Black currants, cherries, chocolate, tobacco, coffee, cola and dusty Asian spices mark this dry, young Syrah. Turns a little rustic and thin on the finish, but the flavors are rich and interesting.",Justice,87,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Roshambo
US,"Defines a style entirely separate from Napa's. Has those rustic Dry Creek tannins and even a briary edge to the blackberries and cherries, and is totally dry. Well-made and elegant.",Reserve,88,13,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Healdsburg Viticultural Society
US,"Zinfandels are always worth a look. Their '03 Old Vine was very good. This is better, with greater depth and complexity. It showcases classic Dry Creek terroir in the dryness, richly tannic structure, and explosively peppery, wild berry and cherry fruit flavors.",Reserve,91,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alderbrook
US,"A very nice, well-structured Cab. It has blackberry flavors with a rich earthiness, and a unique note of blueberries; the oak is light and subtle. Finishes with a scour of rustic tannins. At its best now.",Hulen Vineyard,88,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"Here's a raspingly tannic, high-acid wine that feels astringently dry at first. Then the cherry flavors kick in, and all sorts of complexing herbs, spices and oak influences. It's an interesting red, but those tannins and acids call for something rich and Italian, like chicken cacciatore.",Artist Collection,89,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Imagery
US,"Ripe, with tons of juicy cherry, blackberry, mocha and woody spice flavors, but fully dry. There's good acids and tannins, so it's all balanced and harmonious. It's not an ager, but is lovely and fairly complex.",,88,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fritz
US,"Somebody picked early, to judge from the slightly green, peppercorn notes. But in a way that adds to the complexity, and makes the wine different. It's not a fruit bomb, it's a coffee, herb and blackberry-flavored dry Merlot with structural integrity.",Reserve,88,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Frei Brothers
US,"A creamy drop of vanilla turns the red fruit this way and that; at one moment it's peppery and offers tastes of fennel, and then it is pure plums and cassis. Dry, dusty and earthy, this wine shows solid fundamentals. The early line is for a strong future.",Reserve,89,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Quite a nice Sauvignon, creamy smooth but with good acidity, and flavored with spicy oak. The flavors run toward ripe citrus fruits, figs and sweet tobacco.",,86,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Trentadue
US,"Nice spicy fruit in this clean, crisp wine. It has flavors of peach, mango, pineapple and citrus fruits, and an almost Gewurz-like spiciness. A touch of oak brings smoky vanilla.",Bevill Vineyards,86,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Mazzocco
US,"From a region not known for Chardonnay, this is toasty and pear-tinged. It's a tad heavy, almost honey-like and brooding. The oak is pronounced, but it frames the fruit. A wine of individuality and earthiness, but also atypical.",Stefani Vineyard,88,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"The really ripe dark cherry, toasty oak and licorice aromas and flavors here are winning. It has a wonderful sweetness and balance. The fruit here is rounder and more forward than in the Barelli—still, it's big, juicy and has plenty of structure.",Stefani Vineyard,91,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Slightly sweet but crisp in acids, this pleasant wine features citrus, fig, tobacco and vanilla flavors.",,84,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Alderbrook
US,"Veteran Napa vintner Glenn Proctor turns his sights to old vine Sonoma Zin to craft this robust, effusively fruity wine. It's dry to the palate, laced with rich tannins, and has ripe berry-cherry flavors that veer into raisins.",Old Vine,86,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Puccioni
US,"A chewy wine with tremendous extraction and flavor intensity, this has some Port-like qualities, and the flavors are tart-sweet, pruney, with nutty, almost bitter almond notes peeking through. Still young, it will be better in two years. Coses with a big, tooth-staining finish.",Chiotti Vineyard,88,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"High in alcohol and a little hot and baked in fruit, this single vineyard wine typifies that style from a hot vintage in California. The stewed berry and raisiny-pruny flavors finish fully dry. This Zin will nicely complement a rich beef stew.",,85,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Guerrero Fernandez
US,"Made from the old Clone 1, which gives classic grass and citrus flavors, and the Musqué clone, which contributes brighter gooseberry notes. Absolutely dry, and boosted by mouthwateringly zesty acidity, it also has low alcohol. This is one of the purest expressions of unoaked, non-malolactic Sauvignon Blanc in California.",,91,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Mauritson
US,"Dry, harsh and overripe, this wine has cherry, prune and raisin flavors and an astringent finish. It's not going anywhere.",,81,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Guerrero Fernandez
US,"Way too much residual sugar in this wine, to judge by the white-sugary finish. It's clean and fruity wine, but really should be labeled off-dry or even sweet.",,81,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,STG
US,"It's hard to like this wine. Starts with medicinal, porty aromas, then turns sharp and acidic, with cherry flavors.",,80,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Guerrero Fernandez
US,"This dry white enters the mouth on the grassy, feline side, then finishes rich in figs and pineapples. It has excellent acidity that leaves the palate feeling clean and refreshed. Will be versatile with a wide range of fare.",,87,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Everett Ridge
US,"A dry, fruity red wine from a fine appellation. It has sturdy, dusty tannins and bright blackberry and coffee flavors, and enough acidity to cut through any meats or cheeses you can find.",Angeline,85,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Martin Ray
US,"This is one of the ripest, least earthy Dry Creek Cabs I've ever had. It's quite a lush wine, forward in juicy black cherry and cassis flavors, yet complex, with real depth and length to the finish. Drink now.",,88,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forth
US,"There's an acidic tartness to this wine that's just perfect to balance the slightly sweet flavors. The figs, citrus, melons and peaches are so ripe, they need that burst of crispness, which cleanses and stimulates the palate for food.",,85,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Lake Sonoma
US,"You'll find exotic flavors in this ripe wine, from the usual blackberries and cherries to espresso, anise and baked pie crust. It's soft and voluptuous, but quite sweet, almost off-dry, which lowers the score.",,85,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Waugh Cellars
US,"A vineyard blend that includes 16% Petite Sirah, 2% Carignane, 4% Mataro and 1% Alicante Bouschet. Meaty, funky and ripe, with intense fruit, lots of earthy, barnyardy accents, and a long, tannic finish. This is old style Zin, no holds barred, with full-throttle flavors for aficionados.",Lytton Springs,92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ridge

US,"There's some old-vine juice included in the blend, and it shows. The nose is lushly scented with plums, raisins, pie cherries and ripe red fruits, with some of that distinctive new mown hay quality that old vines send up. A little barnyard aroma too, in a good way. Very extracted and intense.",,89,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
US,"Cherry-scented, clean and fruity. Good concentration mid-palate, with no discernable new oak, just a balanced, firm attack and a strong, chewy finish. Only 123 cases made.",,87,,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Taft Street
US,"There's a lively gaminess to the nose; a wild, Rhônish note, perhaps from the Carignane, Mourvèdre and Petit Sirah blended in. This wine is front-loaded: the flavors lighten up on the palate, and the finish is tight and tannic.",,87,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Peterson
US,"Cortina refers to the soil type. The wine shows forward, pretty fruit, mixing berries and cherries, and follows up with bright, clean, mouth-friendly flavors. Falls off in the finish, with some dry tannins.",Cortina,86,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"Gamy flavors distinguish this wine, giving it a Rhônish flair. There's a good, meaty mouthfeel, red berries and cherries, with lots of tang. The finish falls off quickly though, making for a fairly light impression overall.",,84,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Foppiano
US,"Blackberry aromas with tobacco accents turn slightly barnyardy. Brisk acidity supports the solid, spicy red and black berry fruit here, but the palate feel is rather thin. It's fairly full-scaled, but not particularly graceful, and finishes dry and burnt-toasty, with a briar and tobacco note.",,84,15,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Lake Sonoma
US,"With its bouquet of black plum, leather and dried herb notes, this lean Zin has good berry fruit. However, its attributes are balanced by a note of volatile acidity on the nose, and it shows some definite heat in the mouth. The narrow, rather angular structure of the wine seems to constrain the blackberry and spice flavors here. Closes with full, fairly even tannins.",Frei Vineyard,84,19,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gallo of Sonoma

US,"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show.

A worthwhile new discovery and a producer to watch.",Seven Pillars Jess' Block,93,60,California,Fort Ross-Seaview,Sonoma,Syrah,Hard Six Cellars
US,"This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait.",King Ridge Vineyard,93,80,California,Fort Ross-Seaview,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blue Farm
US,"From a new, small producer, this vibrantly peppery wine captures the power and grace the variety is capable of when grown on the far reaches of the coast.

US,"At last Failla can use this newl-approved appellation for their estate-grown fruit. The wine is concentrated in raspberry and cherry jam and sweet oak flavors. The acidity associated with this extreme western edge of Sonoma County, so near the ocean, is brisk and stimulating.

US,"This is from a block of younger vines made from Dijon clones within the larger Arrendell Vineyard.

US,"With this wine Iron Horse takes a giant step toward great Chablis. By that I mean the intense dryness and zesty acidity, and the tangy grip of iron and wet stone that undergirds the Meyer lemon, pineapple zest, honeysuckle, apricot, cinnamon spice and new oak flavors.

US,"Shows the clear, fine color, silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity that characterize a fine, cool-climate Pinot Noir, but I wish the fruit were a little more concentrated.

US,"Good everyday Pinot, showing the racy acidity and silk-and-taffeta mouthfeel of the appellation and vintage. Bone dry and a little thin in cherry fruit, its tartness calls for food. Ahi tuna tartare will be nice.",,85,35,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Orogeny

US,"A powerful, compelling young Pinot Noir notable for its depth of flavor and classic structure. Floods the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cola, sweet pomegranates, persimmons and spices that last long and clean on the finish.

US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance.

US,"This multivintage bottling is extraordinarily rich in orange fruit. You'll find complex layers of smoky butter, yeasty brioche, vanilla and toasted oak.

US,"Even at five years old, this remains a young, vigorous but rather heavy sparkling wine.

The wine is quite full-bodied and robust, almost rustic, which is mainly due to the powerful, young tannins. With explosive berry, currant and mocha flavors, this powerful wine should hit its stride in mid-2010.",Hailey's Block,95,60,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"Absolutely dry and brilliantly crisp, this clean, vibrant bubbly is rich and subtle in raspberry, lime, brioche and smoky vanilla flavors, with a spicy, lingering finish. Defines the Iron Horse style of elegance and class. Made from 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Chardonnay.",Ultra Brut,94,50,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"A great followup to the '08, which was one of the best Gewürztraminers of the vintage. The '09 is even better, with a crisp, minerally mouthfeel, and superrich flavors of tropical fruits, spices and honeysuckle flowers. No oak, no malolactic and just a slight touch of sweetness on the finish.",Dutton Ranch Green Valley Vineyard,92,25,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",Native Yeast,92,46,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"Notable for its firm minerality and acidity and distinguished mouthfeel. Could be a little richer, but offers intricate raspberry, sour cherry candy, blueberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Might blossom over the next few years. Drink now–2013.",Dutton Ranch Sanchietti Vineyard,92,58,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast. The wine is dramatic, rather than subtle, and is at its best now.",Rued Clone,91,46,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"The 2005 vintage was a very great one for Iron Horse. This 100% Chardonnay reflects the perfect growing conditions. It's dry and especially elegant, with rich brioche, lime and green apple flavors, and a firm minerality in the finish. Drink now.",Blanc de Blancs,91,40,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"There's no oak on this Chardonnay, but it's so rich, you don't even notice. It's all pure, ripe pineapple, orange and lime fruit, accompanied by tart, clean Green Valley acidity. Tremendously versatile with food.",UnOaked,90,26,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"This distinctive Pinot Noir's source is a tiny vineyard in cool Green Valley; the winegrower is James MacPhail, whose own MacPhail Pinot Noirs are so good. The wine itself is totally dry and silky and firm in acidity, yet soft in fine tannins. You might call it noble. It's eruptive in cherries, sweet smoky bacon, raspberry granola and oaky sandalwood. Gorgeous, seductive and brilliant, a truly great Pinot Noir that's impeccable now.",Sundawg Ridge Vineyard,97,50,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sequana
US,"A very good Chardonnay, fancy and elegant, although it's a little sharp in the mouth, and lacks a certain hedonistic appeal, especially at this price. Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.",Corral Vineyard,90,46,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"Shows lots of lusciousness, with rich raspberry, cherry and cola flavors spiced up with cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. The body is silky, just the way Pinot Noir should be. Probably at its best now and for a year or two.",Stephanie's Vineyard,87,30,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,River Road
US,"Very forward in fruit, offering a powerful wave of pineapples, oranges, lemons, limes and peaches. Fortunately, all this richness is dry, and brightened with crisp, tart acidity. Suggests a rich lobster or shrimp risotto.",Estate,90,27,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"Green Valley is the coolest part of Russian River Valley and the wine shows the wind and fog in its crisp acidity and minty quality. But there's a wealth of roasted cherries, along with rich smoky cedar, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined. Should develop over the next six years.",Dutton Ranch,92,40,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sequana
US,"With a touch of raisins and some heat in the finish, this is a pretty ripe Zinfandel. It's not for the faint-hearted. But it's classic California Zin, offering huge blackberry, cola, mocha and black pepper flavors that go on and on into a long finish. Demands rich fare, especially spicy, saucy barbecue.",Von Weidlich Vineyard,90,32,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"A little lighter in body than the winery's single-vineyard Pinots, but no slouch in flavor, this one shows cherries, raspberries, red currants, milk chocolate, Dr. Pepper, licorice and charry vanilla flavors. Structurally, it's balanced with crisp acids and a dusting of tannins.",,88,45,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Offers a tremendous burst of ripe green apples, bosc pears and Meyer lemons, brightened with the crisp acidity of cool Green Valley. Also, tinges of vanilla and cream, despite being unoaked.",UnOaked,89,26,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"You might almost mistake this for a Grenache or Merlot, it's so dark in color, soft and heavy. It's not a bad wine, and actually quite tasty with its wealth of berry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. But it misses the keen, silky vibrancy a fine California Pinot Noir should possess.",Graham Family Vineyard,85,50,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Loring Wine Company
US,"One of the winery's sweeter wines, this Pinot Noir-based bubbly has jammy raspberry, strawberry and vanilla flavors. Ultra-crisp acidity provides needed balance. It's a little heavy, but will appeal to those who want some sugar in their sparkling wine.",Russian Cuveé,87,33,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"Full-bodied and heavy in the Loring style, an extracted wine filled with exciting fruit and berry flavors, but lacking the delicacy and finesse you expect from Pinot Noir.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,85,50,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Loring Wine Company
US,"Not showing all that well now, with cola, currant, plum and oak flavors that are a little jammy and direct, and marked by dry tannins. It's a good, well-structured wine, though, and could just be going through an awkward phase.",Estate,87,50,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"A good brut-style wine, a little sweet in the dosage, but with sound acidity. The bubbles are scoury. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",Classic Vintage Brut,86,33,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"A little sharp and minty, this Pinot is very dry, with acidic flavors of cherries and cola. The mouthfeel is silky. It's not going anywhere, so drink up.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,84,48,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"This is classic Green Valley Pinot, with cool-climate acidity and a firm, almost mineral cleanliness in youth. Elegant, refined and ultradry, it should be aged, to let it soften and allow the cherry fruit to express itself. Best 2007–2010.",Estate,90,35,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"Keefer Ranch has been the source of great Pinots from Failla, Flowers, Tandem and others. This bottling is enormously ripe and forward in vanilla-accented cherry pie filling, cola and root beer flavors, with a good amount of toasty oak. It's a bit soft and sweet.",Keefer Ranch,86,42,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Londer
US,"A bit tough and gritty now, with a chewy texture, like bacon or beef jerky. That's in addition to the cherry, cola, anise and sandalwood flavors. Give this wine a good decant before serving.",Reserve Bottling,89,52,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hawley
US,"Released after five years on the yeast, this is still a young, tartly aggressive bubbly. It is in fact by far the most acidic of Iron Horse's current stable of superb bubblies. But it's enormously rich, offering a wealth of subtle lime, peach, strawberry, toast and sourdough bread flavors that impress with both depth and length, as well as sheer class. Wonderful now, and should age effortlessly for six to eight years.",Blanc de Blancs,93,37,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"Iron Horse's Brut Rosé is always a compellingly rich, full-bodied, fun and delicious wine, and the '03 is their best ever. It captivates with raspberry and cherry flavors, slightly liquored, with smoky char and lees nuances, and possesses fresh, vital acids. One-fifth Chardonnay adds a citrusy brightness. Try with sushi or ahi tuna tartare.",Brut Rosé,92,50,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"Ultrarich and forward in fruit, and what's wrong with that? Floods the palate with pie filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, with a rich coating of oak that adds vanilla, buttered toast and caramel. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity.",Dutton Ranch,91,40,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sequana
US,"No doubt about it, this is a big, lusty Pinot Noir. From a low-production parcel of the estate, it routinely produces immensely concentrated wines. The winemaker's challenge is to give balance and harmony to grapes of this heft, and here, Iron Horse has it figured out. Dry and enormously ripe in cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and cola, it's good now with lamb chops, grilled steaks and similar upscale fare, and should soften and improve for five years.",Thomas Road,95,70,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"This is a really good Pinot, dry and rich, and it shows the balance of power and racy delicacy that Green Valley Pinots, and particularly Iron Horse's, are known for. The cola, cherryskin, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors are quite complex, especially when they create all sorts of waves as they hit the oak.",Estate,92,35,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"As the name implies, this is an enormously likeable sparkler, based primarily on Pinot Noir and showing that grape's sensual texture. With raspberry, strawberry, lime, vanilla and smoky yeast flavors, it's irresistibly good.",Wedding Cuvée,90,37,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"For those who like their sparkling wines a little sweet. This Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blend has the highest dose of residual sugar of all Iron Horse's bubblies, and it shows in the jellied flavors of raspberries, strawberries and limes. Very crisp acidity provides needed balance and elegance.",Russian Cuvée,88,31,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"A powerful, compelling young Pinot Noir notable for its depth of flavor and classic structure. Floods the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cola, sweet pomegranates, persimmons and spices that last long and clean on the finish. For all that, the wine is thoroughly dry, with firm, fine tannins. Try to age it until at least 2011, if you can.",Dutton-Thomas Road Vineyard,94,52,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Easy to like now for its rich, exuberant flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, pomegranates, persimmons and oak that are so delectable through the spicy finish. Dry and silky, it's a Pinot Noir made for pairing with a smoky, grilled steak. Best now and for 3–5 years.",Manzana Vineyard,91,50,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"The grapes seem to have been picked relatively early in order to preserve lively acidity. The result is a somewhat lean wine, with moderate cherry flavors and a sleek coating of oak. Balanced, dry, silky and clean, this isn't a big Pinot, but it's an elegant one.",Estate,88,30,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"With this wine Iron Horse takes a giant step toward great Chablis. By that I mean the intense dryness and zesty acidity, and the tangy grip of iron and wet stone that undergirds the Meyer lemon, pineapple zest, honeysuckle, apricot, cinnamon spice and new oak flavors. This Chard is all about structural integrity. It should have a useful life of at least six years, gaining momentum and nuance.",Rued Clone,94,35,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.",UnOaked,91,25,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"From this appellation in the southwest corner of Russian River Valley comes this big, dark, extracted, jammy, almost Rhône-style wine. It's super-fruity in black cherry and oak flavors, but so full-bodied, you almost wonder if it is Pinot Noir. Still, it's a very nice, well-balanced wine.",,87,30,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Orogeny
US,"Dark berries, earth and toasty oak all come together in this rich, heady Pinot. It may not have the grace of a prima ballerina, but it is full-bodied and satisfying. Probably best to drink over the next 2-3 years.",,87,28,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"Intriguing Asian spice, peanut brittle, pineapple and butter cream aromas comprise the bouquet of this round, well-integrated wine from Sonoma County's tiny Green Valley appellation. Everything flows smoothly into the lingering pineapple, butterscotch, pear and apple flavors in the finish. Top Value.",Cuvée Joy,90,30,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
US,"It's hard to understand how they got this massively ripe fruit from grapes with only 13 percent alcohol. Theories abound. It tastes late-picked, almost porty, with currant, coffee and chocolate flavors, and is full-bodied and dry.",,84,30,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Guerrero Fernandez
US,"Thick and dense in the mouth, with candied flavors of chocolate-covered cherries and new oak, this is a delicious wine that could be a little drier and more structured.

US,"Mac Watson honors the memory of a wine once made by his mother in this tremendously delicious, balanced and complex botrytised white.

This shows off the appellation's mountain fruit and rocky minerality.",Latro,91,50,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Galerie
US,"A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor.

US,"Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt is behind this wine, an aromatic study in campfire and toasty smoke amid a palate of back-of-the-mouth tannins.

It aged in French oak, 70% of it new, for 20 months.",Hillside Reserve,89,75,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ehret

US,"Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure.",Reserve,88,95,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ledson
US,"Beautiful, classic blackberry and currant fruit in this polished Cabernet, along with a rich, tasteful coat of sweet oak. The tannins are thick but refined. The grapes come from this plateau between Napa and Sonoma counties. Tastes young and direct now, but should settle down in 3–4 years.",Pelkan Ranch,89,35,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joel Gott
US,"Made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a big, massively structured wine. It offers an explosion of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet, caramelized oak.

US,"Shows the acidity and cherry-leather flavors this great grape of Tuscany is famous for, and is dry, with a spicy finish. But feels a bit direct and one-dimensional. The next step is to build in complexity. Drink now.",,86,36,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Ledson
US,"There's still a good and pleasant dose of pineapple and apple fruit accented by vanilla spice in this wine, but a mature and overly soft palate-feel suggests that it's best consumed near-term. Finishes smooth and light, with medium length. Drink up this year.",Clos des Pierres Reserve,85,45,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter McCoy
US,"A fine young Cab and a worthy followup to the 2004. Dry and tannic, it shows lush, complex flavors of black currants, mocha and cedar, with an herbaceous quality suggesting green olives. This delicious wine should develop over the next six years.",Bavarian Lion Vineyard,91,45,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Adobe Road
US,"One of a growing family of California whites that marry unrelated varietals, this is a rich, complex and delightful example, with a menagerie of flavors. The blending of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier yields everything from apples, peaches and grapefruit to flowers and honey. Slightly sweet, though protected by a racy acidity. The result is a lot of fun. But because the flavors are strong, it's best matched with the right foods. Smoked fish comes to mind; also fruity salsa toppings.",Alluvium Blanc,89,16,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Beringer
US,"From mountain vineyards comes this deep, dark, impressively intense Cab. Opens with a blast of new oaky smoke, char and vanilla, but once in the mouth, huge waves of flamboyant blackberry and cassis, black cherry and vanilla oak flavors unfold, with a meaty note. The wine is totally dry and balanced, and while it's drinkable now, it should improve through 2015.",Trace Ridge,94,50,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is a new brand from Jess Jackson. The wine is quite interesting—absolutely dry, very tannic, acidic and austere, with a bitterness to the cherryskin flavors. Yet it possesses polish and elegance. Work is needed, but this is a Merlot to watch.",,88,35,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Pelton House
US,"Like many of Jess Jackson's high mountain Cabs, this is extremely tannic and dry, at least by Napa standards. So is it ageable? Probably, given the rich heart of blackberry, cherry, violet flower and coffee flavors. But it's a new brand, unproven. Give it until 2009, then try again.",,88,40,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pelton House

US,"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years.

Brilliant now, and should evolve through at least 2012.",Highland Estates Trace Ridge,94,70,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson

US,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins. Finishes sweet but completely dry, the paradox of a great wine. Drink now–2015.",Highlands Estates Trace Ridge,96,70,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grillé. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013.",Jackson Hills,93,40,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",Highlands Estates Trace Ridge,92,75,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is one of those wines that grows more attractive the more it airs in the glass. At first, it just impresses with ripe blackberry and cassis fruit and lots of oak. As it breathes, subtler notes emerge, lending it charm and complexity. Still, it remains quite tannic. High alcohol may limit ageability, so drink it over the next few years.",,92,115,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pont de Chevalier
US,"The chilly vintage took its toll on this wine, giving it a wintergreen-minty, grassy taste that's very strong, overlaying the lime and pink grapefruit flavors. It's very dry and crisp in acidity.",,86,40,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Pont de Chevalier
US,"This is a big, strong Cabernet, flooding the mouth with intensely ripe blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and white pepper flavors. It's tannic and acidic, and the oak hasn't been integrated at all with the fruit. Everything should begin to come together by 2017.",,90,115,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Knights Bridge
US,"Made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a big, massively structured wine. It offers an explosion of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet, caramelized oak. It's really too immature to enjoy now, but has the inherent balance to ride out the next 10 years until it throws sediment and mellows.",Bella's Blend,92,40,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ehret
US,"Nicely dry in the finish, with a good bite of acidity and smooth tannins. The weakness is a certain thinness of blackberry fruit. For the price, though, you get some elegance.",,86,15,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Don Patrick
US,"Grown in a highlands plateau between Napa Valley and the Russian River Valley, this shows the varietal's bigtime tannins, but it's lighter in body than you might expect. It's delicious in blackberry, currant, grilled meat and sandalwood flavors. This is one of the more elegant and sophisticated Petite Sirahs of the vintage. It's showing its best now and will continue to drink well over the next few years.",,92,36,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Summers
US,"Firm tannins and a dry finish mark this wine. It has a wealth of blackberry, currant and sandalwood flavors as well as a salty, smoky umami taste that suggests grilled bacon. Drink now.",,90,28,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers
US,"This Syrah feels jammy and tannic, but beyond the toughness exist intense flavors of blackberries and cherries that taste like they were baked in pie crust, with additional notes of dried currant, anise, grilled meat and cedar. It's dry and astringent, and all indications point to its ageability. Give this 6–7 years.",Obsidian Vineyard,92,90,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Donelan
US,"A powerful, audacious Viognier, explosive in tropical fruit, vanilla, buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. All that richness is balanced by crisp acidity and a fine minerality. Still, it's a big, honeyed wine for drinking now.",Noble Vineyard Lyra,88,36,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Sean Thackrey
US,"Only a little oak on this wine, so the mass is provided by the fruit, which is extraordinarily ripe and potent. The wine explodes in the mouth, with pineapple, tangerine, lime, peach, acacia flower and honey flavors. The winemaker suggests pairing with blue cheese, and the sweetness combined with acidity suggests this is true.",,90,40,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Pont de Chevalier
US,"Composed mainly of Sémillon, with some Sauvignon Blanc blended in, this is a nice wine for drinking now. It's full-bodied and tastes dryish to semi-sweet, with apricot, peach and citrus fruit flavors.",White Table Wine,87,18,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Ehret
US,"Shows good, deep, classic blackberry and cassis flavors, richly oaked, as well as some hard tannins. Fundamentally closed and aloof now, hiding its riches beneath an impenetrable coating of astringency. Give it 6–8 years in a cool cellar.",Highland Estates Trace Ridge,90,75,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson

US,"Tastes frankly sweet, like sugared blackberry tea. But it has bracing acidity and a nice scour of tannins.",,83,16,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Gamay Noir,Paul Mathew
US,"Quite a good Syrah, although it's a little too soft, so open it now because it won't hold for too long. It's dry and silky smooth in the mouth, with rich, ripe blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, bacon and pepper flavors.",,88,28,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Ehret
US,"A Bordeaux blend made from this high plateau between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Tastes rugged and immature, with bright blackberry, currant and cedar flavors wrapped into tough tannins.

Drink now.",Tecolote Vineyards,86,39,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Elements of Sonoma

Now–2012.",Hillside Reserve,93,32,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ehret
US,"This wine has varied over the years, but with the cool 2010 vintage, it really shows how fine its terroir can shine. A full degree of alcohol lower than the 2009, it's bone dry, brisk in acidity, and stimulating in its minerally taste and texture—like a lick of cold steel. There is a fortunate streak of Meyer lemon candy that lends enough richness to satisfy. Reminiscent of a fine Chablis, it's drinking well now.",West Block,93,65,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Knights Bridge
US,"With high alcohol and 100% new French oak, this wine could easily be clumsy, but it isn't. It defines the ripe California style.

Crisp and dry.",Alluvium Blanc,92,16,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Beringer

US,"It's sometimes overlooked that Jess Jackson produces very small quantities of competitive wines such as this.

US,"Shows the acidity and cherry-leather flavors this great grape of Tuscany is famous for, and is dry, with a spicy finish. But feels a bit direct and one-dimensional. The next step is to build in complexity. Drink now.",,86,36,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Ledson
US,"Weedy and acidic, this Cabernet has very modest flavors of blackberries and currants. The sharpness will not go away with aging. It's an okay wine, but badly in need of greater richness.",Fowler Vineyard,83,25,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Midsummer Cellars
US,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins. Finishes sweet but completely dry, the paradox of a great wine. Drink now–2015.",Highlands Estates Trace Ridge,96,70,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grillé. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013.",Jackson Hills,93,40,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is a new brand from Jess Jackson. The wine is quite interesting—absolutely dry, very tannic, acidic and austere, with a bitterness to the cherryskin flavors. Yet it possesses polish and elegance. Work is needed, but this is a Merlot to watch.",,88,35,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Pelton House
US,"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",Highlands Estates Trace Ridge,92,75,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Like many of Jess Jackson's high mountain Cabs, this is extremely tannic and dry, at least by Napa standards. So is it ageable? Probably, given the rich heart of blackberry, cherry, violet flower and coffee flavors. But it's a new brand, unproven. Give it until 2009, then try again.",,88,40,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pelton House
US,"The hot vintage worked to the wine's benefit, making it richer and riper than the '03. All sorts of forward peaches and cream, custardy citrus, and smoky, creamy oak notes, with good acidity, make this Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon blend a nice upscale white.",Alluvium Blanc,88,16,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Beringer
US,"A fine young Cab and a worthy followup to the 2004. Dry and tannic, it shows lush, complex flavors of black currants, mocha and cedar, with an herbaceous quality suggesting green olives. This delicious wine should develop over the next six years.",Bavarian Lion Vineyard,91,45,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Adobe Road
US,"Over the years my scores for Alluvium have been all over the board. This wine, a Bordeaux blend based on Merlot but with all five classic varieties, is a bit edgy in tannic structure, with a rustic bite. But it's ripe in blackberry, cherry, coffee and rum flavors, and could easily soften by 2010.",Alluvium Red Table Wine,87,30,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Beringer
US,"The wine is ripe enough in blackberries and cherries with a leathery edge, and a pretty coating of sweet, spicy oak. Yet it feels a bit chunky and rustic. Might improve with a few years cellaring.",,86,27,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
US,"Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure.",Reserve,88,95,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ledson

US,"This shows wonderfully layered, complex flavors, in addition to great structure. Thoroughly dry, with rich, fine tannins, it flatters with red and black currant, red cherry, milk chocolate, licorice, root beer, vanilla, dusty spice and smoky oak flavors. Luscious now and through 2010.",Alluvium Red Table Wine,93,30,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Beringer
US,"Beringer's twist on white Bordeaux, this Semillon and Sauvignon blend adds small amounts of Chard and Viognier to produce a tremendously invigorating white wine. Barrel fermented and aged on the lees, it's rich and exotic in custardy pineapple, fig, peach, apple, wildflower and vanilla spice flavors that finish with great length. Crisp and dry.",Alluvium Blanc,92,16,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Beringer

US,"Tastes a little raw, with still-youthful acids, although there's a softness that frames the cherry and blackberry flavors. But this isn't an ager. It's a pleasant, clean Cabernet blend that's drinkable now and through 2006.",Alluvium Red Table Wine,86,30,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Beringer
US,"Tannic and closed to the point of inaccessibility, this Cab-based blend, which contains Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, comes from low-yielding vines grown 1,700 feet above Knights Valley. It all comes down to a question of ageability. The answer is it will age quite nicely. The balance is superb, and the core of fruit is there. Do not open this wine until 2010; it should continue to develop for another 10 years at least.",Les Pavots,93,150,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Peter Michael Winery
US,"It's sometimes overlooked that Jess Jackson produces very small quantities of competitive wines such as this. This 100% Cabernet is a mountain wine, dense in tannins and very dry, yet intense in classically Cabernet black currant fruit. The all new French oak feels natural. As good as it is, more refinement is necessary, but Anakota is a label worth watching.",Helena Dakota Vineyard,92,80,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Anakota
US,"Mountain grapes have yielded an intense, concentrated young Cabernet, grown on the Sonoma side of Mount St. Helena. The wine is brash, dry and astringently tannic now. But it possesses a classic elegance and refinement and a remarkable core of cassis fruit. How could it not develop, given the balance and harmony? Best 2008–2015.",Helena Montana Vineyard,92,80,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Anakota
US,"As rich as a Chardonnay, yet with Sauvignon's distinctive savory profile, this is great wine. From low-yielding mountain vineyards, the juice was barrel fermented and aged sur lies, but no malolactic fermentation was permitted. Few Sauvignons in California achieve this level of complexity. The lush, roasted nuts, with a firm, hard minerality throughout.",L'Apres-Midi,94,42,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Peter Michael Winery
US,"There's still a good and pleasant dose of pineapple and apple fruit accented by vanilla spice in this wine, but a mature and overly soft palate-feel suggests that it's best consumed near-term. Finishes smooth and light, with medium length. Drink up this year.",Clos des Pierres Reserve,85,45,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter McCoy
US,"From mountain vineyards comes this deep, dark, impressively intense Cab. Opens with a blast of new oaky smoke, char and vanilla, but once in the mouth, huge waves of flamboyant blackberry and cassis, black cherry and vanilla oak flavors unfold, with a meaty note. The wine is totally dry and balanced, and while it's drinkable now, it should improve through 2015.",Trace Ridge,94,50,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"One of a growing family of California whites that marry unrelated varietals, this is a rich, complex and delightful example, with a menagerie of flavors. The blending of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier yields everything from apples, peaches and grapefruit to flowers and honey. Slightly sweet, though protected by a racy acidity. The result is a lot of fun. But because the flavors are strong, it's best matched with the right foods. Smoked fish comes to mind; also fruity salsa toppings.",Alluvium Blanc,89,16,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Beringer

US,"This might be one of the best values on the market, given the quality. Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling.

US,"Winemakers fight to get fruit from this coveted vineyard, which famously produces ageworthy Pinots. Siduri's 2012 vintage is surprisingly versatile with lovely raspberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, accented with sweet oak. The balance is impeccable, with fine acidity and soft, refined tannins. You can certainly enjoy it now, but it should also develop well through 2018.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,92,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri

The finish continues the theme, balanced in acidity, a freshness of fruit and lingering cola spice.",UV Lancel Creek Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Friedeman
US,"Most Pinot Noirs would kill to have this depth of flavor. Although it's the winery's most basic, non-vineyard-designated Pinot, it's a fantastic wine, rich, mellow and delicious. Offers wave after wave of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates and persimmons that are as sweet as jam, yet the finish is thoroughly dry. The wine is a masterful blend of seven vineyards. Drink now–2014.",,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Although this Chard is less expensive than the winery's Rochioli or Olivet Lane single-vineyard bottlings, it's their equal in terms of richness. Accented with crisp acidity, it shows rich, flamboyant pineapple, papaya and lime flavors, with the buttered toast of oak barrels.",Westside Farms,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Tart cranberry acidity marks this dry, delicately structured young wine. Dusty with tannins, the mouthfeel is tight and nervous. At the core are complex layers of forest berries, cola, mushrooms, exotic baking spices and sweet cedar. Give the wine at least six years in a cellar to mature—it should be flying high by 2029.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,92,79,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Raspberries, cherries, cola, exotic spices and sweet cedar mark the flavors of this Pinot Noir. It's elegant in the mouth, with brisk acidity, but also a distinct earthiness. The combination gives the wine a yin-yang of weight and weightlessness. It's too young to properly enjoy now, so drink from 2019 and beyond.",Bucher Vineyard,92,59,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A blend of the best barrels of wine sourced from the Don Miguel Vineyard, Cristina is named for Marimar Torres's daughter.

Blackberry and dried herb pop on the finish, providing a darker side to the red fruit.",Hallberg Vineyard,93,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first. Decanting or letting the wine open in the glass will help, but still it retains smooth, velvety tannins and resolved oak.",Dichotomy,91,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Friedeman
US,"An elegantly floral nose is at the forefront of this wine, made from a Forestville site replanted in 2009. Concentrated in dark cherry and vanilla, it's robust and generous in oak and tannin, finding its balance on the finish. Time in the decanter or cellar should open things up as well, through 2020.",Wohler Vineyard,91,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn

US,"A suggestion of minty eucalyptus makes itself quietly known on the entry of this wine, followed by soft, seamless layers of rich red cherry.

US,"This vineyard has been source to Ottomino's best Zinfandels for years. The '08 is right up there, rich and sweet in briary berries, cola, mocha and pepper spice.

US,"Try giving this Pinot Noir 5–6 years in the cellar. It's not that it's undrinkable now, but it's immature, offering just a hint of what it wants to be.

US,"Raspberry syrup and rose hips mark the entry of this wine, an relatively affordable offering from the appellation. Softly layered in red and black cherry as well as more brambly blackberry, it takes on additional complexity in its specks of baking spice, mostly cardamom, before a finish robust in tannin says adieu.",,90,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Another of the producer's estate-grown offerings, this vineyard-designate is bittersweet on the palate, rich and yet softly smooth in anise and waxy apple.

US,"A selection of barrels from the same estate vineyard, this unctuous, brawny wine remains grippy on the palate, needing time in cellar, through 2020.

Drink through the next few years.",,87,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

US,"Lots of sweet cherry fruit in this polished red wine, which also shows the char and cedary flavors of oak barrel aging. It's gentle in tannins and has enough acidity for balance. A nice, everyday wine that brings to mind well-sauced pasta dishes.",Alegria Vineyard,86,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Acorn
US,"Rich, full-bodied and heavy, this is dramatic in its own way. It's certainly ripe and thick, with a flavor of black raspberry jam and a touch of milk chocolate. The high alcohol is suggestive of cherry liqueur. But that's been the Chenoweth Ranch signature for years. Drink now.",Chenoweth Ranch,88,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"A decent Pinot, but a bit funky and sharp. Although this Pinot has jammy raspberry flavors, the mouthfeel is awkward, and the finish is simple and sweet. Disappointing from this prestigious winery.",Russian River Selection,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Dark in color, this Pinot Noir is dry and somewhat heavy on the palate, with blackberry jam, plum and dark chocolate flavors that come with a touch of overripe raisin.

It's not without fruit. You'll find mouthwatering Meyer lemons, sweet Kaffir limes and spicy figs. Just beautiful, and a real sommelier's wine.",,91,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Crinella

A very nice Chard at a good price.",Sonoma Reserve,87,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"A bit tart and disjointed now, and dominated by oak, with flavors of butterscotch, pineapples, green apples and cinnamon spice. But it's young. Give it time. Should knit together in early 2010.",Dutton Ranch,87,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paul Mathew

US,"A great success for this bottling. With extraordinarily high residual sugar, the wine is very sweet in wild honey, infused with the essence of oranges and apricots, folded into rich, buttery custard, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar and cinnamon. It's all balanced with a squirt of lime acid. If that sounds good, it is. Only 95 cases were produced, but finding this wine is worth a search.",Special Select Late Harvest Saralee's Vineyards 375 ml,94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,White Riesling,Arrowood
US,"A marvelous Pinot Noir to drink now and over the next 6–7 years. It feels so rich and elaborate, with waves of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, yet is tightly controlled by firm tannins and a great burst of citrusy acidity. Grows better and better as it warms in the glass.",Estate Bottled,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fog Crest

Delicious.",Laguna West,93,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fog Crest
US,"This is a complicated young Pinot; and while the parts are all pretty and polished, they haven't knitted together. Voluptuous flavors of cherries, cola, spices and cedar are wrapped into silky tannins, and the acidity is fine and brisk, but as good as the wine is, it seems unfinished, like the score to a symphony that has yet to be played. Give this until mid-2008, and it should be terrific for the next four years.",Nicole's Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"I like the elegance, but it seems like it was rushed to market. It will certainly benefit from cellaring, as it's young and rude in acids right now, and not showing well. But there's something here in the vast heart of  cherries and pomegranates and overall balance. Should improve by the end of 2007, and hold for another five years.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,91,53,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"The oak stands out, giving this Pinot a vanilla, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast dominance over the underlying cherry jam fruit.

US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, dry and silky and rich, with complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood and white pepper. Easy to drink now for its sleekness and elegance. Only 296 cases were produced but a single-vineyard wine worth seeking out.",Gunsalus Vineyard,93,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman
US,"Big, juicy Pinot, dry and fruity, with layers of flavor that change with every sip. Black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, coffee, sweet tobacco, spice and oak all mingle in a myriad of sensations, finishing long and intense. Good now, but tannicly closed enough to warrant cellaring beyond 2007.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Midnight black and drily astringent, this is not a wine to pop open tonight. But it's extraordinarily ripe and deep in black currants, with all kinds of earthy cocoa, balsamic, basil, Portobello, coffee and spice flavors. It will blossom and knit together with some time in the bottle. Best 2008–2011, at least.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield

US,"The entry on this single-vineyard Chard is strangely neutral. It's not until the middle palate that a blast of sweet, vanilla-y toasty oak hits, and also pear, mango and spice flavors. From then on, it's a satisfying wine, rich and elegant.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Heavy, with blackberry and blueberry jam and pepper flavors wrapped into strong tannins. It's a dry, well-ripened wine, but needs greater liveliness and complexity, especially at this price.",Allegria Vineyards Axiom,85,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"Lots of zesty acidity in this Pinot Noir, giving the pomegranate, rhubarb, red cherry and licorice flavors a bright edge. The wine is very dry and complexly layered. Interesting now, if a bit primary in fruit, and balanced enough to develop additional nuances over the next six years.",Mononi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Only a fine, cool-climate vineyard could have grown this Pinot. It combines ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors with crispness and a delicate, silky mouthfeel. The end result is a dry, complex wine of considerable charm and a drink-me-again deliciousness.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kindred
US,"Pale, light-bodied, fruity and dry, this is the un-Cabernet, the red for white wine lovers. So easy to enjoy, you might overlook its complexities. Red cherries, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cinnamon and ginger candy, it's really delicious. Drink now for its freshness.",,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alderbrook
US,"Showing quite a bit of tannins and acids, this is a very young wine, of a kind that isn't seen all that much in Russian River Valley these days. Swan makes their Pinots the old-fashioned way, for aging. Dry and astringent, the wine has a deep core of cherry and blackberry fruit, almost like a Merlot, except for the silkiness. Stick this in your cellar until 2008, at least.",Great Oak Vineyard,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"My experience of Swan Pinots is that they've been made the same way for a long time, and require aging. This one shows some hard tannins and even some tough acids, although it's tremendous in cherry-pie filling, black raspberry and blackberry jam flavors. Right now it feels juvenile, rude, even rustic, but five to eight years in the cellar will reward.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Straddles the line between villages-type and premier cru Pinot. Light in color and body, one minute it seems simple and fruity, the next, it shows the complex dimensions of a fine young Burgundy. Hard to tell where it's headed, but it's a dry, crisp, silky wine, with lip-smacking cherry, cola and oak flavors.",Saralee's Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon

US,"Very fruity, in fact superfruity, this wine attacks with ripe pie-filling raspberries, red cherries, pomegranates, cola and vanilla-cocoa flavors that flood the mouth, lasting through a long, spicy finish. All that fruit is balanced with crisp acids, while a touch of dusty tannins adds to the fullness. Drink now.",Reserve,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
US,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",O'Neel Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards
US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"From the cool Green Valley, a wine that didn't get quite ripe this year. There are citrus flavors alongside bell pepper ones and the taste of various herbs. Plenty of oak and lees makes things more complex, but it's still a lean wine that demands foods to wake it up.",Dutton Ranch,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Effusively fruity. It's like taking every fruit in the produce department and making wine from all of them. But tangerine and lime dominate, made bright and crisp with acidity. A tad of residual sugar makes things round and juicy.",,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,J Vineyards & Winery

The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.",Bacigalupi Vineyards,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",Sonoma Reserve,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"Another polished, succulent release from a vineyard that's not supposed to be warm enough to ripen Cabernet. Of course, the vintage was very good, and this effort shows upfront blackcurrant and leather flavors, with a long, fruity finish. It's generously oaked, and really excellent.",Rochioli Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard

US,"Lusty, full-bodied, powerful, classic Sonoma Zinfandel.

US,"Sonoma Valley Cabernet specialist Cohn reaches to the Russian River to expand his portfolio with this Pinot Noir. It's not a stretch to call it Bordeaux-style. Although it has the variety's telltale silkiness and medium body, the blackberry, cola, coffee, leather and oak flavors, not to mention the tannins, possess density and gravity, which may make this wine ageable. Best now through 2011.",,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
US,"High in acidity and bone dry, this light-colored Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional right now, but I think it was released too early. It should gain momentum by the end of 2007, when the cherry, rhubarb and cola flavors become more integrated with the tannins and oak. If you have to drink it now, decant for several hours.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,89,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri

US,"Crispness and dryness mark this elegant young Pinot Noir. It feels silky, almost delicate in the mouth, but with powerful cherry, pomegranateand cola flavors. Should develop for up to six years in the bottle.",Longbow,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Really young now, this vineyard block bottling needs a little time to come into its own. Tasted in February, a combination of acidity and bottle shock has made it brittle.

The mouthfeel is a little rough and scoury.",Vintage Brut,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"A vigorous wine. In its youth it's bright and jammy in raspberries, cherries and currants, with fine, silky tannins and citrusy acidity, like a squeeze of lime. There's oak here, too.

Drink now–2013.",,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista

US,"Notable for its dryness and minerally tang, this is a tight, young Chardonnay right now. The flavors veer toward grapefruits, with notes of passionfruit and honeysuckle.

US,"This is one of the winery's ripest, softest current Pinot releases. It's dry, but a bit heavy in mouthfeel, with a slightly stewed quality to the cherry and berry flavors.

The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop. It should age through the next decade.",Pennacchio Vineyard,96,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach

Yet the finish is entirely dry, and you'll find plenty of scoury acidity to rip through the greasy richness of lamb or duck.",Maboroshi Vineyard,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Despite vastly rich tropical fruit flavors and plenty of sweet oak, this wine is equipped with brilliant acidity and a stony minerality that give it balance. Kudos to the winemaker for letting the terroir shine through. Will be fine with the richest Chardonnay-friendly foods you can muster.",Emelia's Cuvée,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano

Still shows vibrant acidity, but the fresh fruit character, the most likeable part of such Chardonnays, is disappearing, replaced by more herbal and vegetal notes.",Estate,85,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"Very rich and ripe, marked by pure, intense flavors of cherries, blueberries and spicy cloves. It displays the balanced elegance and thoughtful winemaking of this winery.

US,"Overripe and pruny, with jammy blackberry and molasses flavors. Too heavy and sharp for balance.",,83,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Verve
US,"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less.

US,"This is the best of the winery's new releases, both for drinking now and for cellaring.

Production was an astounding 109,000 cases.",Estate Vineyards,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rodney Strong
US,"Made in the ultraripe style that is Williams Selyem Chardonnay, this wine almost needs to be enjoyed by itself as a cocktail. It's explosive in apricot jam, pineapple tart, pear crême brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that feel fat and dry and slightly hot in alcohol. Not particularly subtle, but earns points for sheer power.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem

US,"This wine saw no oak barrel aging, but it's so rich and satisfyingly clean, it's probably better off not being weighed down by caramel and buttered toast. Brimming with brisk acidity, it shows brilliantly pure citrus fruit, tart gooseberry, Asian pear, green apple, mineral and white pepper flavors. The vineyard is in Green Valley.",Cohen Vineyard Dutton Ranch,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate

That's due to the tannins, which are thick and noticeable in the way they create an astringency through the finish. The flavors are exceptionally rich, suggesting cherries, raspberries and tobacco, with a welcome sweetness from toasty oak.",OFS,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Packed with ripe, upfront raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, this Pinot certainly delivers in the flavor department. But it goes well beyond that, framing the richness in a fine structure of smooth tannins, crisp acidity and a deft application of oak. Straddles the line between immediate drinkability and ageability, so drink it now and over the next four years.",Appian Way Vineyards,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
US,"A tremendous Syrah, so rich and tasty, it makes you wonder why more people don't drink this variety. Shows intense, explosive blackberry, currant, bacon and black pepper flavors, with a savory hint of raisins. New oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dramatic and lush, this single-vineyard Syrah will provide good drinking over the next four years.",Goosechase Vineyard,93,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"A beautiful wine, fully resolved in age, showing a classy, smooth mouthfeel. The citrus, bread dough, vanilla and spice flavors are subtle but delicious, while the bubbles have softened, making the wine creamy. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, this delicious bubbly is made for drinking now.",Late Disgorged Vintage Brut,93,90,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"With exceptional dryness, acidic crispness and minerality, this Chardonnay can be described as Chablis-style. The structure is certainly noble, and nobody would ever accuse it of being a fruit bomb despite the rich pineapple tart and lemon drop flavors. Hard to predict its future, but probably best over the next four years.",Barrel 16 Estate Grown,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Shows all the hallmarks of an ageable Pinot Noir. The raspberry, cherry and cola flavors are very rich, but the structure is immaculate. Fine, firm tannins combine with zesty acidity to create a tightness in the mouth. As nice as this Pinot is, it will develop bottle nuances over the next six years.",Floodgate Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
US,"Shows the ripe fruit of Balletto's Pinot Noirs, with bright, forward raspberries and cherries. But there's an appealing earthiness, something like wild mushrooms sautéed in olive oil. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast. Drink now–2015.",Winery Block,92,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"Quite an impressive young Chardonnay, with brisk acidity, a tangy minerality and a bone dry finish. You'll find suggestions of pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors, with a kiss of smoky oak. Chill it well, then savor it as it warms in the glass.",Estate Grown,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Pretty simple, but the price is right for an everyday, clean Chardonnay. Shows modest, fruit juice flavors of pineapples and oranges, with a hint of butter and cream.",,83,12,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Castle Rock
US,"This is a restaurant-style Pinot Noir, classy and restrained. It shows classic raspberry, cherry, cola, pomegranate and spice flavors, with brisk Russian River acidity and a silky mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager, but it's a lovely wine now and for the next few years.",,92,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
US,"This is a big, gutsy Syrah. It's strong and astringent in tannins and potent in ripe, fruity blackberries and plums, with a spicy edge of smoked bacon. The overall balance testifies to a pedigreed address and superior grapegrowing. As savory as it is, it's not really ready for drinking. Hold for up to six years.",Ledbetter Family Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"Tastes a bit remote and hard now, with a steely minerality that accentuates the acidity, and even boosts the tannins. Underneath that are clean, vibrant pineapple, Meyer lemon, golden apricot and lime flavors. This is one of the rare California Chardonnays that should improve with some age. Hold for 3–4 years, maybe even longer.",Jewell Ranch Vineyard Estate Grown,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Extraordinary for how drinkable it is right now, and for how it will evolve. Shows the crisp acidity and minerality of this cool-climate vineyard, with rich flavors of raspberries, cherry liqueur, cola, exotic spices, vanilla, buttered cinnamon toast and smoky sandalwood. Yet the tannic integrity should help it change in fascinating ways over the next six years. Decant for several hours.",Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard,95,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"So dry, so crisply acidic, so silky in the mouth, and so rich in flavor. This is a truly distinctive Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's elusive personality, now rich in cherries and currants, withdrawing into minerals and herbs. Yet the final impression is of fine, silky decadence. Should develop in fascinating directions over the next 6–8 years.",Buena Prierra Vineyard Helio Doro Block,95,90,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Brogan
US,"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California. Dazzles with tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with a brilliant overlay of oak that adds buttered toast and spice flavors, not to mention sturdy oak tannins. But it's the zesty acidity, like a squirt of lime juice, that really elevates this wine.",Ulises Valdez Vineyard,95,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paul Hobbs
US,"A wonderful Syrah, one of the most drinkable on the market. It's delicious, with thick, soft tannins housing dry, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola, anise and black pepper.",,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard

Extra points for crisp acidity and lovely tannins.",Burnside Road Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"Give this wine a year or three in the cellar, unless you like your Pinots a little on the tough side. Tannins and earthiness currently dominate the polished raspberry and cherry flavors. If you do drink it now, decant for a few hours, but not overnight.",BCD Vineyard,91,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"Shows lots of fruity richness, with Asian pear, pineapple, peach and green apple flavors, brightened by crisp acidity. It's surprisingly fresh for a 2008 Chardonnay, but you should drink it quickly before it starts to go downhill.",,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ancient Oak Cellars
US,"A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with strong, but not heavy, flavors of strawberries and raspberries. There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure.",Rose of Pinot Noir,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Lynmar
US,"Beautiful and likeable for its dryness, crisp minerality, and the sleek, clean mouthfeel. The fruit suggests oak-inspired pears, oranges and citrons. This elegant quaff gets better as it warms in the glass. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now. Soft and savory, it shows appealing raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, accented with the vanilla and toast of oak. Defines Russian River Pinot Noir in its easiest form.",,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum

US,"Shows the massively extracted raspberry, cherry, cola and anise flavors this block of the estate vineyard produces, with rich oak influences. No denying the opulence and immediately decadent appeal, or the silky, tapestry-like texture. Seems off a bit from the fabulous 2007, a little fatter, hotter and more obvious, but still a very flamboyant Pinot Noir. Drink now–2013.",Bliss Block,91,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A wonderful Gewürz. You never know what to expect from this varietal, but in this case the wine is basically dry, and freshly crisp in acidity. The flavors are complex, ranging from oranges, pineapples and honeysuckle to star anise, toffee and the famous spices of Gewürztraminer. There's also a rich, creamy texture.",,91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Novy
US,"Made in an immediately appealing style, this Pinot has forward raspberry and strawberry jam, cherry pie, Dr. Pepper, vanilla custard and smoky sweet oak flavors. It's so delicious, you hardly notice the tannin and acid firmness. But that will protect it and enable it to age for 6–8 years.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there. It needs a year or so in the bottle to emerge, and even a brief decant will bring greater harmony to this expressively opulent wine.",La Sereinité,91,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"This is an uncomplicated, delicious Pinot Noir. What you taste is what you get. It's all about flashy raspberry, strawberry and cherry jam, toasted oak and spice flavors, wrapped into Pinot's inimitably silky texture.",,89,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto

US,"This blend of Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne, in roughly equal measures, is technically incorrect. It's a little dirty, a little fizzy and a little too sweet for a dry table wine. But you know what? It's fun to drink, and that's wine's ultimate obligation. Shows rich, satisfying flavors of apricots, oranges, peaches, honey and herbs, finished with a dry minerality.",3 Divas,88,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Montemaggiore
US,"A softly tannic and dry Zin. Offers wild berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors, with a meaty edge, like beef teriyaki. Easy to drink with a perfectly grilled steak.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast.

US,"Very ripe and bright in lemon, lime, apricot, apple, pear, vanilla, buttered toast and honeysuckle flavors. The acidity is strong and bright. It's a good, rich Chardonnay despite needing more subtlety and complexity.",Nagasawa Vineyard,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paradise Ridge
US,"Pretty rich and exotic for a Sauvignon Blanc, with tropical fruit and orange fruit flavors that might easily be Viognier. But it shows Sauvignon's zingy acidity, and finishes a little sweet. Easy to drink on its own.",Grandview Vineyard,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Paradise Ridge

US,"Soft and fruity, with raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper and oak flavors. It has the jammy, marmalade taste of freshly crushed berries, with citrusy acidity. The oak is front and center. Might develop with a few years in the bottle.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Waits-Mast
US,"There's an aroma and taste of hay, or dried twigs, in this Pinot that dominates the cherry fruit. It's also pretty tannic. This undoubtedly is due to the winemaker's style, resulting in an earthy, dry wine that might develop over the next six years or so.",,87,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Terlato
US,"A solid, flashy Russian River Chardonnay, rich in pineapple, kiwi, tropical fruit and oak flavors, and brightened by crisp acidity. With a creamy, buttery texture, it's a solid hit down the middle of the popular style.",,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Davis Bynum

Drink now.",Pagnano Vineyard,82,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ancient Oak Cellars
US,"Extraordinarily delicious. Earns its reserve citation for the sheer power and audacity of fruit. Masses of ripe raspberry and cherry tart, vanilla and cola flavors dazzle the palate. The all-important tannins are softly refined, and the acids are crisp. Designed to dazzle now, and does, but should gain traction and age in interesting ways over the next six years.",Reserve,94,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Matrix
US,"All kinds of fantastic things swirl together in this complex, intricate Pinot Noir, but it's too young to touch for a while. The '09 vintage was a great one for Arista's Pinots, and this bottling is their best, a small-production blend of four vineyards. Purists will object that it's a little too forward in sweet fruit, but the raspberries and cherries have interesting cola and mushroom complexities that sing of the soil, while lots of new oak adds rich layers of toast. Beautiful, but needs 4–5 years to begin to come around.",Two Birds,94,68,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Masses of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and mashed ripe pears in this marvelous wine, but that's not all. Buttered toast, crème brûlée, bananas sautéed in butter and brown sugar are some of the additional complexities. That makes the wine sound sweet, but it finishes dry.

US,"Deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic dusty spices, this Pinot Noir has a tannin-acid tightness that makes it aloof and hard. Although it's dry, it's so rich in fruit, it tastes sweet. A very fine wine, but needs some time to come around. Give it four or five years to mellow.",Reserve Nunes Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Matrix
US,"A big, rich, flashy Chardonnay that's designed to impress, and does.

US,"Soft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice. Terrific with mushroom risotto.",Wholer Vineyard,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinotage,Longboard

US,"The winery's most accessible and available Pinot Noir—still quite small in production—is from several vineyards, including single-vineyard sites like Jenkins. It offers classic Russian River Valley cola spice and bright aromatics and acidity, the texture soft and structured, a smaller percentage of new French oak used for aging.",,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"The winemaker has said he makes Russian River Valley Pinot Noir to support his Syrah habit. Here he offers a compelling case in point, making a velvety, substantial 100% Syrah that's more elegant than overpowering.

US,"A 100% varietal wine, this comes from a property formerly known as the Preston Ranch, with which the producer has worked for a long time.

But there's also a strong streak of tart green gooseberries.,River Ranches,86,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
US,"Not much Cabernet Sauvignon remains in the Russian River Valley, making this wine an outlier worth seeking. Cinnamon and nutmeg dust the entry, followed by a persistent level of baking spice on the palate.

While powerful, it holds on to nuance via streaks of high-toned citrus, allowing the wine room to breathe and remain lighthearted.",Campbell McKinney Vineyard,90,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Grenache,Kobler
US,"A strength of oak and burly black fruit in this single-vineyard designate makes it intense and big. In the background, an unexpected minty, forest floor quality overtakes the aromas at first, but blows off over time. The wine finishes as intensely as it starts, awash in toasty oak.",Bush Crispo Vineyard,89,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Ram's Gate

Drink now through 2022.",Katherine Lindsay Estate,96,85,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Paul Hobbs
US,"From a vineyard within the Santa Rosa Plains, this wine opens in pretty, floral aromas of violet and gentle rose. Seductive, it follows with bursts of blood orange and wild strawberry that remain faint and delicate on the palate, light and clear in color, and elegant in intensity. Still, there's enough backbone to the wine to keep it fresh and alive through the long finish.",Toboni Vineyard,94,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"You can taste the California sun in every sip of this gorgeous Pinot Noir. It brims with luscious raspberries and cherries accented by brisk acidity and a hint of sweet, smoky oak.

US,"A blend of three estate-farmed vineyards, this is a velvety-smooth expression of the variety. It conveys a touch more richness and concentration than some of the producer's other wines, at least at the beginning of the glass, when almond and hazelnut rule the day. But then it takes on a lightness toward the lengthy finish, ending in a mix of lemon zest and apple.",Estate,90,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Thomas George

This is surely one of the best Zinfandels of the vintage.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,94,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem

US,"This small-production Chardonnay (only 272 cases) is exceptionally rich and ripe, as Williams Selyem Chardonnays consistently are. Intense flavors of tropical fruit and pear pie (with a smoky, buttery crust) make for a powerful palate. The acidity is mouthwatering. This is the ideal wine for cracked crab and a sourdough baguette with butter.",Drake Estate Vineyard,94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Cool vintages make Hanna's Sauvignon Blanc a little green and minty, and 2012 was another cool vintage. The wine is dry and low in alcohol, with a grassy, gooseberry taste.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"Waxy apple stars in this brisk, approachable white from a single estate-farmed block, the oak briny and salty in toast and honey.

US,"This is a fun discovery, a tantalizing mix of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grown from estate vineyards in cool, acid-driven sites within the appellation ideal for sparkling.

US,"Here's a Pinot to enjoy over the years. Right now, it's all about primary fruit—raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper cola.

Drink from 2015–2019.",Hallberg Vineyard Dijon Clones,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"This elaborately named Pinot shows Farrell's 2011 signature of rich, brooding earthiness. Tasted now it's a bit clumsy, with raspberry, cherry, mushroom and oak flavors that are scattered and random. With time, it will collect itself seamlessly. Age it for 6–8 years.",Hallberg Vineyard Dijon Clone 777 7% Whole Cluster,93,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell

US,"While this Pinot isn't in the same league as the winery's 2011 Precious Mountain or Allen vineyard wines, it's a gorgeous wine nonetheless. With moderate alcohol and vibrant acidity, it offers complex layers of cherries, raspberries, cola, sandalwood and exotic spices. You won't be disappointed if you hold it until 2019.",Williams Selyem Estate Vineyard,93,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

US,"Tannic and tightly wound, this has an astringent resistance, but because the flavors are so powerful, it's already delicious. Intense notes of raspberry jam, cherry pie, anisette, Dr. Pepper are all present, and a rich, sweet jacket of smoky sandalwood adds further complexity. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar, but it could last for 15 years if you enjoy mature wines.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,94,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"The opulence of this Chard comes at least as much from the buttered toast and caramel notes of oak, as it does from the underlying pineapple and tropical fruit flavors. It's a crowd pleaser. Drink now.",Estate Vineyard Olivet Bench,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Dark in color and offering opulent aromas of crème brûlée and marshmallow, this vineyard-designate is marked by its wealth of orange blossom aromas, an inviting, floral entry.

US,"Barrel-fermented, this is dripping in honey and caramel surrounded by ripe golden apple and passionfruit. Accentuating the richness is a balance of acidity and texture, making for a beautifully complex wine.",Estate,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rock Wall
US,"The winery specializes in Zinfandel. While the Maboroshi Vineyard has produced great Pinots for other wineries, this one is tough in tannins. Give it a good, long decant and drink up.",Maborishi Reserve,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutcher Crossing
US,"Clear and light in color, this complex vineyard-designate sings in tea and nutmeg spice, allowing for richer, riper flavors of baked cherry. Velvety in texture, it builds to a full-figured finish, echoing that initial savory intrigue of black tea.",Dutton Ranch Widdoes Vineyard,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lucie
US,"Baked apple and pear laced in caramel come to mind first, evoked from the aromatics of this wine. A richness of honey beckons, too.

US,"What distinguishes the Stony Block from the winery's other selections is its minerality, but also a fluidity in the wine—as if the rocks were melted into the fruit.

Drink from 2016 and beyond.",Stony Block Don Miguel Vineyard Unfiltered,93,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate

US,"It's easy to create ripe, oaky wines, but attaining true complexity is something else. This Chardonnay, which was made from fruit sourced from a highly regarded vineyard in the cool mid-southern part of the Russian River Valley, is elaborate, dry and rich in green apple, mango and orange flavors. The acidity is just about perfect, giving the palate a tart zinginess. Drink this with lobster and crab, and don't forget the buttered bread.",Saralee's Vineyard,94,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Swan Vineyards

US,"Plush on the nose and palate, it offers soft, round characteristics of candied fruit and tobacco, more savory than sweet. Still grippy in tannins and weight, the finish is sealed in black tea and mushrooms. Good acidity brings out the wine with food.",,88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
US,"The Dobles Lías has more lees contact than Marimar's other Chardonnays, giving it a rich, yeasty creaminess. There's also plenty of new French oak influence. Made from estate-grown fruit, it's rich with papayas, tangerines and guavas. It's delicious now, but has all the structure a Chardonnay needs to negotiate the next eight years.",Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard Unfiltered,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate

The finish is grippy and marked by a pronounced and inviting nuance of earthy forest floor.",River Road Ranch,89,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Trione
US,"This is a standout wine for the vintage, but it's too immature to fully appreciate now. The palate is ripe and rich with cherry and raspberry flavors touched with a briary, sappy aroma.

US,"There's quite a bit of new French oak used in this blend, adding complexity in the form of buttered toast notes. But the wine is really all about fruit—massive flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots, oranges, pineapples, peaches and honey. While that sounds like a laundry list, if you pay attention you'll find each strand of the tapestry. At the same time, it's bone dry and balanced with acidity. Don't drink it too cold.",Don Miguel Vineyard Estate Grown and Bottled,92,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Albariño,Marimar Estate
US,"Winemakers fight to get fruit from this coveted vineyard, which famously produces ageworthy Pinots.

US,"Tart cranberry acidity marks this dry, delicately structured young wine. Dusty with tannins, the mouthfeel is tight and nervous.

US,"Raspberries, cherries, cola, exotic spices and sweet cedar mark the flavors of this Pinot Noir. It's elegant in the mouth, with brisk acidity, but also a distinct earthiness.

US,"Tasted in February, 2014, this Pinot was showing a slight effervescence, not unpleasant, but considered a flaw. The spritziness might calm down with a few more months in the bottle. The wine itself is dry, silky and solid in cola, raspberry jam, orange peel and sandalwood flavors.",,84,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Masterpiece

US,"The Olivet Grange vineyard is in the foggy southern part of the valley, where Pinot Noir is seldom opulent in youth. With this cool 2010 vintage, the wine is tightly wound with acidity and tannins masking inherent cherry, cranberry, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors.

US,"This vineyard-designate opens with intoxicating aromas of violet and rose before expanding on the palate into seamless, sturdy waves of juicy pomegranate and red cherry. Earthy and somewhat feral, it ends with a note of black tea.",Balletto Vineyard,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"This is Marimar's unoaked Chardonnay from the estate vineyard. In keeping with past vintages, it's so rich and savory, you won't even notice the absence of barrel influence. The wine is rich and complex in tangerine, apricot, lime, lemon and vanilla flavors, brightened by exquisite acidity.",Acero Don Miguel Vineyard Unoaked,91,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"The east side of the Russian River is home to some of the winery's best vineyards, and this wine exhibits the excellent structure, nerve and ripeness of all of their 2011 Pinots. It's forward but nuanced. Drink now–2017.",Eastside Road Neighbors,91,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Made in a dry, light style, this Pinot  Noir has a silky mouthfeel and citrusy acidity that gets the tastebuds whistling. It has intense flavors of sour cherry candy and Dr. Pepper, and the oak influence lends an edge of sweet toast. Seems at its best now and over the next few years. It will pair well with tuna tartare.",,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Huge Bear
US,"Woody in aroma, this is an exceptionally light-bodied, floral and herbal white, marked most by its high-pitched acidity that threatens to veer into extreme territory. Instead, beeswax and white peach figure into the mix, finishing in a refreshing twist of lemon.",Kobler Family Vineyards,89,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Kobler
US,"With sugary blackberry and prune flavors, this tannic Zinfandel is pretty simple. It will pair well with burgers, tacos and barbecue.",,82,12,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Masterpiece

Oak brings rich notes of caramel and honey. The alcohol is nice and low.",La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate

While it's dry, it's incredibly rich in tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with loads of honey and buttered toast from oak barrels. The acidity is just fine.",Keefer Ranch,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"Take Souverain's basic Chardonnay, released last year, oak it up, and you get this reserve. Buttered toast, butterscotch, apricot, tropical fruit and honey flavors are prominent. Ready to drink now.",Winemaker's Reserve,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Souverain
US,"Crisp green apple, lime and vanilla wafer mingle on the palate of this 100% Chardonnay, méthode champenoise sparkler from the Bazzano Vineyard. It drips with minerality, lively and tangy with a medium to light body that picks up depth and breadth on the finish.",Blanc de Blanc,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paradise Ridge
US,"A whiff of smoky campfire opens this wine, followed by an unlikely counterpoint of lavender. Notes of black cherry and strawberry then unfurl, along with plenty of earthy mushroom and forest floor. The wine reveals a tension of weight and body as it evolves in the glass, with a bite of tannin on the finish. Let it open a bit.",Trenton 1880,91,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,E16

Let this powerfully built wine open in the glass.",,88,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Della

US,"Sourced from vines over 103-years old, this wine has unusual concentration of flavor, in the form of black and red raspberries and Dr. Pepper.

US,"This blend of multiple varieties, some of them rare in California, can be described as rustic. It's dry, tannic and moderate in alcohol, with pretty cherry, red currant and pepper flavors. Needs food, especially cheese, to tame it.",Acorn Hill Alegria Vineyards,86,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Acorn

US,"Sweetly exotic in fresh-squeezed pineapple aromas, this wine might be trying too hard to be light and restrained, employing very little oak in the process. Pear and lemon stay on the palate the longest, the finish brisk in acidity.",,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kobler
US,"From the producer's estate vineyard, the grapes planted on budwood from Napa Valley's famous Three Palms, this wine is bittersweet in tannin and flavor, a mix of blueberry, cedar, resin and clove. Full bodied in style, it maintains an elegance on the finish, marked irresistibly in dark chocolate.",DaKine Vineyard,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard

The oak and a sprinkling of nutmeg remain firm and focused on the finish.",Dutton Ranch George Vineyard,88,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Martin Ray

There's a mellowness to the finish, where grapefruit comes back to the fore, sprinkled in honey.",,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Cuvée Wine Cellars
US,"A troubled Pinot Noir. The mouthfeel is all wrong, lacking Pinot's sensuality, but marked by harshness. And the raspberry and cherry flavors have a green, minty edge. Not likely to age, so if you drink it now, give it a good long decant.",Floodgate Vineyard West Block,85,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alysian
US,"Not quite ripe, with a vegetal, herbal edge to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The acidity is nice and brisk, and the texture is beautifully silky, but that tug of greenness distracts, and limits ageability.",River Ranch,85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Renteria
US,"Very rich and ripe, marked by pure, intense flavors of cherries, blueberries and spicy cloves. It displays the balanced elegance and thoughtful winemaking of this winery. Young and juicy now, it should develop in the bottle for a year or two, but some sharpness in the finish will ultimately limit ageability.",Dutton Ranch,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is a tough wine, marked by hard acids and tannins, and an absence of the fruit to stand up to it. It's bone dry and severe, with thin cherry-skin and cola flavors.",Hopkins Vineyard,82,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Meunier,River Road
US,"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",Quail Hill Vineyard,95,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Lucky Failla gets to source grapes from this vineyard that most winemakers would trade their left arm for. It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wine—light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry.",Keefer Ranch,95,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Dry and tart in sour cherry candy and cola flavors, this Pinot has hints of mint and tobacco that suggest the grapes weren't completely ripe. Drink now.",,85,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stomping Girl
US,"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold.",Cool Coastal Vineyards,90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Although this Zin has a touch of overripeness in the form of raisins covered in chocolate, followed by a lot of blackberry and foxy mulberry. The wine is dry, smooth and balanced, with plenty of complexity.",,89,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"Richly intense, this wine wraps thick textures of caramel and toffee around tropical mango. The full body celebrates ripeness while finding enough restraint.",Baker Ridge Vineyard Estate,88,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Thomas George
US,"VML is one of the newest wineries in Sonoma County. They took over the site previously occupied by Belvedere, in the heart of the Middle Reach of the Russian River. High ambitions have been realized with this beautiful bubbly. It's really an exceptional wine—richly textured and creamy—with hints of strawberries, lees, toast and vanilla, and none of the coarseness that can characterize lesser sparkling wines.",Blanc de Noir,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,VML
US,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",Susanna's Vineyard,94,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",La Serenité,94,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins. This shows the pedigree that comes from this famous vineyard, as well as the Williams Selyem signature of extreme class and deliciousness. Drink over the next five years.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,94,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",Rochioli Vineyard,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Cellar this young wine for 5–6 years to let it mellow. Right now, it's aggressive in tannins and acids. The core of cherry, black raspberry, rhubarb and plum flavors is strong, which suggests that the wine will age.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"This tastes a little vegetal, but it's dry, crisp and creamy, with decent orange and peach flavors.",Suzanne's Blend,85,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gracianna
US,"Showing sweet toasty oak, brisk acidity and pure flavors of citrus fruit and apricot, this is a very rich, dry Chardonnay, although all of its parts haven't quite come together. While it's not an ager, it will benefit from holding until mid-2013, but not any longer.",Horseshoe Bend Vineyard,89,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"Richly intense, this wine wraps thick textures of caramel and toffee around tropical mango. The full body celebrates ripeness while finding enough restraint.",Baker Ridge Vineyard Estate,88,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Thomas George
US,"The Dijon clones (667 and 777) used in this wine yield unusually pure, intensely clean flavors of raspberries, cherries and anise, at a moderate alcohol level. The vineyard location and cool vintage must have contributed to the acidic bite. It's a very fine wine—elegant and noble—but immature. You'll want to cellar it for 5–6 years to allow it to show its stuff.",Hallberg Vineyard-Dijon Clones,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Fantastic fruit, tantalizing acidity and overall balance mark this Pinot. It's ripe with cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb and persimmons, while plentiful new oak is perfectly in keeping with the underlying power. Drink now, after proper decanting, or age over the next 5–15 years, as it gradually reveals different sides of itself.",Rochioli Vineyard,93,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"An awesomely rich Pinot Noir, this is a big wine that's darkly colored and intensely layered with raspberry, chocolate, spice and mushroom notes. Lots of new oak shows up, but it's balanced against the wine's power. Delicious now, but should reward aging over the next eight years.",Stony Block Don Miguel Vineyard Unfiltered,93,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"The Chardonnays from this Farrell bottling are always very fine and among the most consistent across vintages. The 2010 shows ripe, concentrated tropical fruit and green-apple flavors, brightened with crisp, Russian River acidity. Deft, firm and delicious, it will provide great Chardonnay pleasure over the next 4–5 years.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"This is a big, vital, dramatic Pinot Noir that shows its fine terroir with enormously concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit, balanced by fine acidity, subtle tannins and a bite of cherry-pit bitterness. It's a great wine that will benefit from 6–8 years in the cellar.",Quail Hill Vineyard Block 10,93,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar

US,"There's a strong dose of green gooseberry in this wine that makes it distinct, although you'll also find riper notes of limes and grapefruits. It's quite dry and crisp with acidity, finishing with mouthwatering tartness.",River Road Ranch,86,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Trione
US,"A soft, easy wine to drink now. It's rich and ripe with apricots, peaches, green apples and limes, with a spray of fragrant honeysuckle. Finishes a little hot in alcohol.",,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,MacMurray Ranch

US,"This is a notable wine for its smooth, supple tannins and its intense flavors of black cherry jam, mocha, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. It's a full-bodied selection for drinking soon, and be sure to pair it with almost anything involving cured meat.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This wine captures the essence of Swan's 2010 Pinot Noirs. It shows the effects of the cool vintage, and it bears an earthy, mushroomy inflection to the plummy and cherry-like flavors.",Cuvée de Trois,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"One of the best Californian Pinot Gris currently available, this is rich, creamy and complex, and it would make for a great alternative to Chardonnay. This wine traditionally ages in used oak, which imparts just a hint of wood-driven sweetness to the pear, peach, mango and lime flavors.",Trenton Station Vineyard,90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is a very pretty, polished wine for drinking now. It has rich, creamy flavors of tropical fruit and sweet, smoky oak that are brightened by crisp acidity.",Reserve,88,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"A good, fairly complex California Chardonnay, marked by ripe, jammy orange, pear and apricot fruit flavors. Winemaker interventions also play roles, with the malolactic fermentation adding buttery notes and French oak contributing sweet caramel.",Dutton Ranch,89,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Light, clear and aromatically reminiscent of pine, this smooth, soft wine offers spicy acidity around integrated tannins and oak, finishing with a length of cinnamon.",,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Willowbrook
US,"A bright and relatively light expression of the variety, this wine imparts more red berry than black, with seasonings of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft, smooth and unfussy, it retains solid acidity from start to finish, with a taste of vanilla custard on the finish.",,88,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto

Crisp acidity makes for a clean finish, making this Pinot worth repeated sipping.",Graham Family Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,August West
US,"With an alcohol reading of only 13.3%, this Pinot offers a refreshingly light alternative to darker, heavier bottlings in California. It's silky in the mouth, despite some firm tannins, with subtle, complex raspberry, red currant, tobacco, mushroom, balsam and spice flavors. Lovely now, and should have no trouble developing in the bottle over the next eight years.",Burnside Road Vineyard Estate,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"While this lacks some of the immediate appeal of prior vintages, it's a better structured wine, with tannins and a rich vein of acidity that gives a framework to the flavors of blackberries, roasted meats, currants and pepper. Give this 3–4 years in the cellar.",Walker Vine Hill,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Donelan
US,"This Zinfandel's tannins are starting to resolve, which gives the palate a soft, melted quality. The primary flavors are transforming into rich, dried black-raspberry and cherry notes, with leather, mocha, dried mushroom and spice accents.",Mancini Ranch,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"With hints of dried hay, white pepper, lemon, Asian pear and mineral that are brightened by searing acidity, this elegant, bone-dry wine will complement food—not dominate it.",Estate Bottled,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Foppiano
US,"This is a light, crisp white from a tremendous vineyard source. A mix of cucumber and white peach at the heart of this wine makes it seem lighter than it is. Oaky caramel vanilla closes out the finish.",Catie's Corner,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Foundry

Kudos to winemaker Ed Kurtzman for bringing it all together.",,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,August West
US,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.",Heintz Vineyard,92,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"So sweet. With sugary tangerine and pineapple flavors and plenty of caramel, it quickly palls.",,82,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rued
US,"Right out of the bottle, this is tight and acidic. While it's rich in raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors, not to mention oak, it's jammy, fresh and direct—in an immature way. Give it a few hours in a decanter and drink it with rich lamb and steak dishes.",Horseshoe Bend Vineyard,88,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Occidental Road Cellars

US,"With this bottling, Marimar Estate confirms itself as one of the two best, most consistent producers of Albariño in California, along with Longoria. The wine is brilliant, with brisk acidity, dryness, modest alcohol and complex flavors of citrus fruit and zest, minerals, white tobacco and ripe figs.",Don Miguel Vineyard,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Albariño,Marimar Estate
US,"An exceptionally good Pinot, from a winery that frequently gets overlooked, perhaps because they're not charging an arm and a leg. The wine is light and silky in the mouth, with alcohol well under 14%, and marked with crisp acidity and fine-grained tannins. The flavors are classic pomegranates, rhubarbs and black cherries. Should develop over the next 4–6 years. What a great value.",Estate,92,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"A strong, punchy Pinot Noir, ungainly now for its immaturity, showing tons of jammy raspberries and cherries. The acidity is tart, which is good in a wine this rich, providing balance, and there's also a scour of tannins. All indications suggest cellaring this wine for at least six years.",Stiling Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"A whiff of petrol leads off on this oaky, full-figured white, which is creamy and textured with a touch of sweetness on the finish.",Estate Grown,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"This fresh, softly mellow and creamy wine is utterly captivating with bright summer red-berry and tree-fruit, vanilla, cherry liqueur, brown sugar and toast flavors. Absolutely delicious now, it is a silky feast for the senses and should easily negotiate the next 8–10 years.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,92,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The vineyard is near Sebastopol and the Green Valley, and the wine shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk terroir that gives the raspberry, sweet red cherry and persimmon fruit such bite. It's enormously attractive to drink now for sheer lusciousness, but has the integrity to age for 10–15 years, perhaps longer, depending on your taste for older Pinot.",Hallberg Vineyard,92,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Concentrated and elusively complex in cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors, with a hint of red tomato and bloody red meat that testifies to the cool vintage. It's a big, dense wine, but also quite tannic, and a little high in alcohol, giving it a full body. A bit ungainly now, but impressive nonetheless for sheer power. Give it six years in the cellar.",Nugent Vineyard,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stemmler
US,"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists.

US,"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,96,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a brand-new bottling from Merry Edwards. It's her first from Westside Road, which is warmer than her haunting grounds around the southern part of the valley. It's quite a promising debut. The wine is round, soft, charming and complex, with elaborate cherry, blackberry, licorice and cola flavors. It feels important and ageworthy. Drink now, with several hours of decanting, or cellar through 2020.",Georganne,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards

US,"This Pinot Noir may become more rich and charming in coming years, but right now it's fresh, tart and jammy in raspberries and cherries.

US,"With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style.",Winery Block Estate,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"This Sauvignon Blanc impresses for subtle elegance. It's not the biggest or the fruitiest, doesn't dazzle with richness, and doesn't club you over the head with oak. Instead, it offers dryness, crisp acidity and tart green apple, lemongrass, cream and vanilla flavors.",,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.",Flax Vineyard,95,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"From the winery's own Westside Road vineyard, formerly called Litton, comes this grandiose, if immature, Pinot Noir. In its youth it's all about primary, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit. On the edges are fine acidity, smooth tannins and a perfect appliqué of oak. Shows the hallmarks of this great, emerging vineyard, but needs serious time to come around. Try after 2015.",Estate Vineyard,95,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Some will critique this Pinot Noir as being too big and extracted, and lacking delicacy. But Olivet Lane Pinots are seldom delicate. You look for massive fruit and elaborate construction, and that's what you find in this fabulously exotic wine. It's a beauty, rich, dense and opulent, with complex cherry, rose petal, dark chocolate and new oak flavors, wrapped into firm, refined tannins. Just gorgeous now, with a few hours of decanting, but it will easily develop bottle nuances for a good eight years.",Olivet Lane,95,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"The vineyard is in the coolest part of the valley, the southerly part Merry Edwards calls the Golden Triangle. The wine is dry, tannic, bright in acidity and insanely rich. Just floods the mouth with cherry, cola, anise, pomegranate and mulberry flavors, with an earthiness suggesting mushrooms. Just great now, with decanting, and will easily develop in the bottle through 2020.",Coopersmith,95,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is the most broadly appealing Chardonnay of Lynmar's wonderful 2011 offering. It makes all the right moves, with fine acidity and a hint of minerals giving structure to the tropical fruit, buttered toast and spice flavors. It's the kind of wine that makes Chard lovers smile. Best of all, it costs considerably less than  the winery's other Chards and is nearly as good.",,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"A worthy followup to the 2007, perhaps not as immediately flamboyant, but a major Pinot Noir to age in the cellar. Shows flashy cherry and raspberry fruit, with tantalizingly rich spices and a perfect coating of sweet, smoky oak. Fine and delicious now, after decanting, and should develop over this decade.",Saralee's Vineyard,94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Some unripe mushroom and leafy notes compromise this silky wine, along with richer flavors of cola. The alcohol is nice and moderate, but the cold vintage has taken its toll. Drink up.",R. Buoncristiani Vineyard,84,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Orentano
US,"A simple Sauvignon Blanc, this is ripe with orange and lime flavors. It finishes clean and zesty with acidity.",,84,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Taft Street
US,"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now.",Westside Farms,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Right out of the bottle, this Pinot smells grapy and winy, almost as though it were still fermenting. It's young, rude and fresh, but very rich in cherries, with a pie-filling sweetness. Should be fine by this winter.",,87,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Darms Lane
US,"This bottling from John Tyler has been variable over the years. The 2009 offering is dry, silky and crisp, and it bears pleasant red currant, sour cherry candy and persimmon flavors. Drink now–2015.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"This is a soft, simple wine. It shows good Gewürztraminer character in its spiciness, but it's mild in flavor, with a sweet finish.",Estate Bottled,82,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Balletto
US,"This is a very good price for a Zinfandel this fine. It's fairly delicate in mouthfeel for a Zin, with a light silkiness, and the tannin-acid architecture is elegant. As for the actual flavors, they're intense in red fruits, currants, sweet licorice and pepper. Hard to imagine a better wine for drinking over the next few years with barbecue.",Estate,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto
US,"Great price for a blush wine this sophisticated. Lynmar manages to tame Syrah's power and exuberance into elegant sleekness, resulting in a dry, tart wine with vibrant raspberry, orange zest and vanilla richness.",Rosé of Syrah,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Lynmar
US,"A terrific Merlot, a real pleasure to drink and one of the stars of the vintage. The cool Russian River Valley has given it a great acid-tannin structure, yet this 100% Merlot is rich and flamboyant in cherries, blackberries, plums and bacon. Pricey, yes, but worth it.",,93,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Ledson
US,"Very little of this bottling was made. It's an experiment in making a white wine the way one would a red, fermented with skins and seeds, then aged eight months in new French oak. It's not for everyone. Cloudy and funky, it's teeming with acidity and yet somewhat dense on the palate, the fruit muted in favor of a taste of flowers and clay.",100% Skin Fermented,86,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Notes of buttered toast, butterscotch candy and caramel popcorn flavors dominate this wine. Underneath all that is a wine with pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",,83,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Taft Street
US,"Green, unripe vegetal flavors mark this Pinot Noir. It does have some decent raspberry and cherry flavors, but turns sour on the finish.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,81,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gracianna
US,"There's a fresh, lilting quality to this Pinot, a silky airiness that feels weightless on the palate. Doubtless that's due to the moderate alcohol. But there's nothing light about the flavors, which are complex in black raspberry pie, softened Dr. Pepper cola, butterscotch, toast and spices. A beautiful Russian River Pinot made for drinking now with upscale fare.",,90,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Tightly wound still, this wine isn't showing much yet beyond ripe cherries, pomegranates and new oak. Firm tannins and crisp acidity provide structure, and the finish is dry and long. But the balance and complexity suggest that this block selection will age well. Hold until 2018.",Jane's Vineyard Garfield Block,90,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"This wine combines ripe raspberry and cherry flavors with sweet, smoky oak tones. A wine to drink now, it shows classic Russian River acidity, and it bears a minerally, salty profile that lends structural elegance.",,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,97,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"An awesome wine. So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness. But you'll also find a firm tannic structure that gives it some astringency. It's the kind of Pinot Noir that California does at its best, drinkable now for sheer beauty, but easily capable of a decade of aging.",Klopp Ranch Méthode a L'Ancienne,96,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.",Quail Hill Vineyard Summit,96,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Merry Edwards has figured out the magic trick of crafting Pinot Noirs so luscious right out of the gate, you want to drink them now, but that actually are ageable. This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors. Yet the inherent balance of tannins and acids ensures it a long life. What a treat. Now–2016.",Flax Vineyard Méthode a L'Ancienne,96,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A fabulous, lush Pinot Noir, dry and silky. Crisp coastal acidity brightens the complex flavors of raspberries, cherries and spices, with sweet oak influences, and there's a rich tang of minerals from the earth. It's ridiculously delicious now, but with a tug of tannins, it should develop over the next six years, at least.",Quail Hill Vineyard Old Vines,95,120,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, showing sweet raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Brilliant acidity and wonderfully soft tannins make this Pinot instantly drinkable, yet it should age over the next 6–8 years.",Quail Hill Vineyard Bliss Block,94,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Brilliant acidity, dryness and tangy minerality mark this Chardonnay. The grapes come from the estate vineyard in the cool, southern part of the valley. Shows tangy, steel-tinged flavors of pineapples, oranges and honeysuckle, with an extraordinary richness that finishes dry.",Quail Hill Vineyard,94,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"This ripe wine is intense and full bodied, with sultry layers of baked apple and peach. A flinty note marks the finish.",Director's Cut,86,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Amazing that a winery would hold back an estate-grown Syrah for five years before release, but Joseph Swan did with this wine. It's still pretty tannic, but the core of blackberries, blueberries and dark chocolate is starting to explode into the secondary characteristics associated with aged wine. And that is very exciting, especially at this price. Should continue to evolve over the next five years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Strikes a nice balance between the softness of the '08 and the firmness of the '07. A beautiful Zinfandel, made in the winery's style of big, ripely extracted fruit and high alcohol. Massive in raspberry and cherry jam, red licorice, gingersnap cookie, cola, clove, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, its extraordinary richness is balanced with fine, thick tannins.",Papera Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"The vineyard is in a very cool, damp part of the valley, and this particular bottling always shows a dry finish, considerable tannins and an earthiness not found in warmer parts of the appellation. This 2008 follows those lines. It has a dense core of sour cherry candy fruit, with some superripe currants. Will age interestingly over the decade.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,92,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"A hard wine to like. It's very dry and somewhat overripe, with a pruny, raisiny edge, and the acidity sticks out in a harsh way. This also is the highest alcohol wine of Benziger's trio of 2008 Pinot Noirs, and it feels hot in an unbalanced way.",San Remo Vineyard Signaterra,84,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benziger
US,"Light in color, this delicate wine is herbal and yet bright in Bing cherry, quite nuanced and slight at first, unveiling its concentration and complexity slowly and seductively over time. Made by longtime grape growers, the acidity is lively and the weight slim, traces of restrained oak and garden herb dancing in the background. Only 54 cases made.",Nunes Vineyard 777,94,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,St. Rose
US,"Not quite ripe, with a stemmy, minty quality dragging down the bright raspberry and cherry fruit flavors. Although the tannins are wonderfully smooth and the wine is fully dry, it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.",Robert Thomas Vineyard Block 2,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Rich and forward in fruit, in the way of Saralee's Pinot Noirs, with savory raspberry and cherry jam, rhubarb pie and spice flavors. It's brisk in acidity and fairly tannic, but light and delicate enough to drink now.",Saralee's Vineyard,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"This is tart—like a squeeze of lime was added to the wine. The acids brighten the raspberry and persimmon flavors to give this Pinot Noir a mouth-watering quality. The acidity is characteristic of the cool vintage and the vineyard's location, which is in the cool southwestern part of the valley. Drink now–2015.",Whitton Vineyard,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high. You can drink this instead of a red wine with lighter meats, such as lamb or pork.",Rosé of Pinot Noir,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Lynmar
US,"A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014.",Allen Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"An enormous wine, rich and complex and tannic enough to cellar. Made from the estate vineyard in the Sebastopol area, it floods the mouth with savory cherry, cola, rhubarb, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors, wrapped into a silky, velvety texture. Feels classic, but you do want to give it some time. Drink 2012–2016.",Meredith Estate Méthode a L'Ancienne,94,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Fat, oily, unctuous and honeyed. Shows massive pineapple, mango, tangerine and Asian pear fruit, with a savory spiciness and plenty of sweet, smoky oak. As ripe as it is, it's saved from simplicity by brilliant acidity, a mineral cleanliness, and a thoroughly dry finish.",Heintz Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"An interesting wine. The tomato edge it shows would normally be considered a sign of unripeness, but in this case it's a delicious Heirloom variety. Conjoined with black cherries, cola and exotic mulberries, dusted with rich, Indian spices, and finished with sweet oak. Don't drink this dry, tannic and complex young wine now. It needs 5–6 years in the cellar, and could go the distance.",Zephyr Farms,94,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A rich, dramatic wine that impresses for sheer deliciousness and elegance. It's pretty much as good as the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but considerably less in price. Dry and silky, it shows beautiful acidity that makes the raspberry, cherry, cola, rhubarb, bacon and spice flavors sing. Drink now–2015.",,94,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Superrich in pineapple, lime, kiwi and tropical fruit flavors, this lovely Chardonnay has a rich, balanced overlay of sweet, smoky oak. A blend of Lynmar's various vineyards, the wine's brisk acidity and minerality shine through, making the richness bright and clean. A brilliant Chardonnay to drink now.",La Sereinité,94,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"A gorgeous Pinot Noir, dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity, with a silky texture housing complex cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Oak adds lush vanilla and toast notes. Really lovely now, and should develop over the next six years.",Quail Hill Vineyard Lynn's Blend,94,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A blend of seven vineyards scattered across the valley, this is a full-bodied, ripe Pinot Noir whose tannins suggest cellaring. Thoroughly dry, it shows deep notes of blackberries, black cherries, clove and pepper spice and smoky, vanilla-scented sandalwood. Feels elegant. Give it until 2013, at least.",,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, rich and ripe in fruit, yet balanced with dryness and racy acidity and a fine minerality. The pineapple and orange flavors are accented with sweet, smoky oak. Drink this luxuriously elegant wine now.",,93,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"A really beautiful wine, softly crisp and silky, with gorgeously ripe flavors. Raspberries and cherries that were baked into a pie flood the palate, accented with sweet vanilla, toast and cinnamon spices. The acidity is clean, vibrant and perfect. Drink now and over the next six years.",Quail Hill Vineyard,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar

US,"Light in color it's composed of violet and rose petal aromas, zippy in acidity, with layered dark cherry fruit and an earthy, herbal backbone. With texture on the palate, it has a buoyancy and electricity of minerality and finishes with the slightest suggestion of anise. Only 72 cases were made.",Nunes Vineyard Ten Block,93,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,St. Rose
US,"A pretty good Pinot Noir, not quite up there with J's vineyard-designated bottlings, but it's not as expensive. With brisk acidity and black cherry, cola and cedar flavors, it's made for drinking now.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"This wine was given quite a bit of time in bottle. It offers cranberry, olive and a sanguine touch of dried cherry. Medium in weight and oak, it finishes with tart acidity.",The Farm Vineyards,85,67,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"Tasted in early spring, this Chard was still tingly with acidity, but by the time you read this, everything should have calmed down. It's terrifically ripe with green apple, nectarine and tropical fruit flavors that are so rich, you won't even miss the oak.",Unoaked,90,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Incredibly rich and sweet with honey, apricot and orange flavors, this intense dessert wine is balanced with citrusy acidity. It's super-delicious, long and gooey sweet on the finish.",Vin de Paille Estate,89,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Balletto
US,"Elegant in construction, with fine acidity and a sleek mouthfeel. What really stars are the flavors. Massive in raspberry and cherry pie filling, cola and pomegranates, with lots of peppery spices and a smoky oak envelope. Should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",Hawk Hill,93,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Tight in acidity and tannins now, but very complex, offering a range of cherry, tangerine zest, mushroom, cola and Indian spice flavors that swirl to a long finish.

US,"This  Pinot Noir has deep flavors of cherry and persimmon, plus a lush application of sweet oak. It has a sandpaper-like mouthfeel, and it might benefit from a few years in a cellar. Otherwise, decant it for a couple hours before serving.",Dutton Ranch,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Nothing shy about this wine. It erupts like a fruit volcano, offering wave after wave of raspberries, cherries and ripe persimmons, sweetened with vanilla and butterscotch tones of oak. The mouthfeel is all silk and satin. Drink now for sheer pleasure.",,89,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"A rich, spicy wine, marked by cinnamon and clove-accented raspberries, cherries, cola and mushrooms, as well as a bit of funk.

Now–2015.",Westside Road Neighbors,92,69,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Rich cola, pomegranate, rhubarb, cherry, currant, tomato and flashy oak flavors in this dry Pinot Noir, and it has a nice, silky texture. Feels a bit heavy and one-dimensional, though, and seems to be showing its best, so drink now.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Furthermore
US,"This tight, classic Russian River Valley Pinot Noir needs coaxing to bring out the lovely, lilting aromatics, splendid in savory dark fruit, cinnamon and tobacco. Restrained use of new oak brings a balance of richness and acidity, softened tannins and velvety texture that works in every way.",Floodgate Vineyard,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell

It finishes quick and lean.",Three Sons Cuvee,84,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck

With a silky texture, it's a lovely wine to drink now.",Reserve,89,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"Easy to drink, with some sweetness to the pear, apricot and orange flavors, like a drizzle of honey on fresh fruit.

US,"A big, ripe, voluptuous Zinfandel, packed with flavor. The deliciousness factor of blackberries, cherries, anise and dark chocolate comes at the cost of high alcohol, which limits the wine's elegance but makes it super-drinkable with the richest barbecue imaginable.",Trenton Station Lion Ridge,91,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Shows the rich tropical fruit and oak flavors that are so easy to achieve in California. But there's a balancing minerality, like a lick of cold steel, and the acidity is brisk and cleansing. This is a lovely Chardonnay, dry and elegant, and a relative value.",Cuvée de Trois,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Swan Vineyards

Drinks better at room temperature, like a red wine.",,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Merry Edwards
US,"Intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit marks this impressive young Pinot Noir. It shows Williams Selyem's impeccable balance and elegance, but is a little soft and direct, lacking nuance. Could do interesting things in the bottle down the years, but seems best now and through 2014.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,91,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Strikes a nice balance between fat, rich, decadently ripe raspberry and date fruit, with a drink-me-now appeal, and a more serious undertow of tannins, mushrooms and pine. Give it a good decant, and focus on what's going on in the glass.",Zeigler Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards

US,"This wine is filled with robust Zinny flavors, ranging from wild raspberries and red currants to tobacco, mocha and crushed black pepper. It's just beginning to pick up aged notes, making it sweeter and more mellow than it would have been two or three years ago. Kudos to Balletto for holding it back before  release. Drink now–2016.",Estate,89,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto

US,"The trick with Vognier is to take its exotic fruit and contain it with acidity and dryness. Swan's '09 accomplishes that task. It's big in tropical fruit and orange flavors, but crisp and minerally, and the finish turns dry and clean. A beautiful restaurant Viognier.",Catie's Corner,91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Joseph Swan Vineyards

US,"Winemaker Greg Morthole plays all the bells and whistles on this Burgundian-style Chardonnay. Barrel fermentation brings toast and sweet vanilla to the tropical fruit and green apple flavors, while the full malolactic fermentation adds notes of buttered popcorn. The acidity is racy and clean.",River West Vineyard,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Davis Bynum
US,"This is a good Syrah for drinking now, with rich berry, cherry, mocha, brown sugar and roasted meat flavors. The tannins are brisk, and there's a nice cut of acidity. This is far from the winery's best Darien Syrah, but it's delicious.",Darien Vineyard,88,53,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Nickel & Nickel
US,"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly.

US,"Shows the racy acidity and brilliantly ripe flavors of the winery's finest Chardonnays. The pineapple, mango, pear, lime and green-apple fruit purity is massive and impressive. There's a sweet vanilla note that must come from the grapes, as no oak ever touched this lovely wine.",Unoaked,91,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Tuck this puppy into the cellar for a long time, at least six years. The tannins are fierce, a drone attack on the palate that numbs it flat. But it's very rich and sweet in raspberry essence, with good Russian River acidity. An interesting California expression of this grape variety.",Matthew's Station Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Tannat,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is a preview of Swan's vineyard-designated '09s yet to come, and it sure is exciting. It's a beautiful, sensual wine, rich in acidity and delicious in raspberries and cherries. Near perfect for drinking now.",Cuvée de Trois,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"A beautiful Gewürztraminer showing classic spice, honeysuckle and tropical fruit flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Great to drink now with spicy fusion fare. Only 151 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",Saralee's Vineyard,90,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Tasted in October, 2010, this Pinot had a spritziness indicating some instability, making it hard to evaluate. That could calm down eventually, leaving behind a big, flavorful and dry red wine, brimming with berries, cherries and cola.",Bohemian Vineyard,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Furthermore
US,"Fragrant and inviting in dark cherry, raspberry and cola spice, this medium-weight Pinot Noir is lush and meaty. Bright flavors veer from dark cherry to raspberry, with a pronounced lift of earth and herb. The wine is layered, beautifully textured and long in the finish.",Hallberg Vineyard,91,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
US,"This is a rare premier release from the winery's new vineyard. It's a blend of different clones, and only 47 cases were produced. The wine is very exotic. It shows tiers of raspberries and cherries, but also more feral notes, of dried meats or leather, mushrooms, tart balsam, tangy minerals and scads of dusty, sweet Indian spices. Tannic and dry, it should unfold slowly over the next 10 years.",Block 10 Mass Selection Estate Vineyard,94,68,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The Russian River Valley makes some of the state's greatest Sauvignon Blancs, in the right hands, and when those hands are Merry Edwards', you can be sure of what you're getting. The wine is dry and crisp in mouthwatering acidity, with citrus and lemongrass flavors that have richer tones of tropical fruits. It feels vibrant, elegant and complex in the mouth, a wine to savor over multiple glasses.",,93,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Merry Edwards

US,"This might be one of the best values on the market, given the quality. Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling. The tannins and oak are lightly imprinted around strawberry-rhubarb and fresh-cut rose, and the texture seductively silky. This is a delicious treat of a wine that should also age.",Russian River Selection,95,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"A fine Pinot from this veteran producer. They haven't lost their deft touch despite changes in ownership. The wine is classic Russian River, showing full-throttle berry-cherry fruit, balanced with good acidity, while maintaining a delicate mouthfeel. It's complex enough to warrant repeated sipping.",Jane's Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"A big, lusty Zin, with a blast of briary raspberry, cherry, cocoa, beef jerky, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors.

Best now and over the next six years, before the fruit starts fading.",Old Vine,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Beaver Creek
US,"Lots of zesty, crunchy acidity marks this wine, giving it a brisk mouthfeel. Beyond that clean dryness, you'll find complex raspberry fruit flavors, enhanced with sweet oak and vanilla. Drink this vineyard-blended, elegant wine now.",Freestone,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar

US,"This Zinfandel is a bit high in alcohol, which gives it a rustic-like heat. It's dry, and while the tannins are firm, they're supple. Somewhat overripe, this has flavors of blackberry jam, prune, plum and mocha. Fans of big, full-bodied wines will love it.",Alegria Vineyard,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rock Wall

US,"Lots of sweet, ripe, jammy blackberry, blueberry and raspberry fruit in this sweet, silky wine. Oak, too, plays its role in contributing toast and caramel notes. A little too ripe for comfort, but delicious. Drink over the next six years.",Bucher Vineyard,90,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"At nearly five years of age, this wine tastes like it was just bottled. It's still juicy and fresh in raspberries, cherries and spices, with a sweet, clean finish. A pretty, polished and complex wine to drink now and over the next 6–8 years.",Mancini Ranch,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Sharp and minty, with modest red cherry and cola flavors. The thinness of fruit accentuates the tannins and acids. Nice and dry, but lacks generosity for a pricey Pinot Noir.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Inman Family
US,"Inviting in honeysuckle and tingling acidity, this wine is crisp, medium-bodied and complex, tasting lighter than it is. Silky in texture, it's one to enjoy on its own or with something buttery and creamy, like lobster or crab.",Kobler Family Vineyard,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Kobler
US,"This is a tremendous blend of various vineyard sites, coaxed together into a stunning combination of beautiful floral aromas, ginger and baked lemon. Given time in half new oak, it takes on flavors of apple and vanilla, never venturing out of range and remaining balanced and textured.",,94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Dripping in earth, kir and fresh raspberry, this is a stellar wine from the heart of the appellation, estate-grown from a four-acre spot planted to a trio of clones.

US,"From one of the winery's two estate vineyards, Harper's is dense and oaky, with bittersweet chocolate, dark cherry and black tea twisted around a layer of thick, dense tannins. Dried herbs and a subtle squeeze of tangerine provide savory and exotic character, while the finish is velvety and sublime.",Harper's Rest Estate Grown,94,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",Monastery,88,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"The oak presently stands out, giving a blast of buttered toast, drizzled with honey. But the wine is very crisp in acidity and balanced and ripe in pineapples, pears and green apples. Could be an interesting bottle to cellar for four or five years.",,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"One of the best unoaked Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Clean and briskly acidic, it shows complex lemongrass, Meyer lemon, orange, green melon, fig, mineral and spice flavors. Could finish a bit drier, but it's an outstanding wine for cocktails, Asian fare and seafood salads.",Block Collection River Ranches,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
US,"Minty and sharp in acidity, and not offering much richness now, especially at this price, although it does feel stylishly dry and elegant. Shows proper cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"Sweet and oaky, this Chard tastes like a vanilla and caramel cream soda, with alcohol and a squirt of pineapple essence. Defines the superripe, opulent style, without much complexity.",,86,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paoletti
US,"With rich, decadently delicious raspberry and cherry pie filling flavors, this is an impressive young Pinot. It's so sweet in fruit and oak, yet entirely dry in the finish, and the silky texture and elaborate oak overlay are just perfect. Hard to predict its longterm future, but it will make for elaborate drinking over the next four years.",Lancel Creek Vineyard,92,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Thomas George
US,"Ripe enough in raspberry, cherry and mulberry fruit, with some flashy notes, but it's all sweet, upfront flavor, with not much else going on. The acidity is fine and the tannins are pretty, but this ultimately is a fairly simple, jammy wine.",Hallberg Vineyard,85,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"This is a lighter style of the variety from a stellar vineyard, a crisp take on red cherry, dried cranberry and pomegranate that's deliciously balanced and sublime.

US,"From a cool Forestville vineyard once devoted to apples, Appian Way is rich in Goldridge soils, providing a happy home to these grapes that offer a core of pomegranate and cranberry, laced in black tea. Light bodied without being wimpy, the wine is complex and velvety, finishing in nutmeg and ginger.",Appian Way Vineyards,93,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
US,"Ripe, fleshy and opulent, this wine is also balanced and light on its feet, cohesive in oak and tannin. Dark cherry is the star, accented by anise, cola spice and a compelling hint of orange peel. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table, while also standing out on its own.",Leras Family Vineyards,93,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Papapietro Perry
US,"Very ripe and fruity, offering wave after wave of pineapple, orange, mango, peach, green apple and vanilla. Tastes honeyed and ripe in fruity essence, but fundamentally this is a dry wine. Brilliant acidity helps to provide a clean balance.",Teresa's Unoaked Estate,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Balletto
US,"This sugary-sweet dessert Chardonnay tries hard to please, offering waves of honey, tangerine, mango and vanilla flavors.

US,"Shares the richness of EnRoute's previous bottlings, with jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, elaborated by classy oak. Yet it finishes a little too sweet and soft, lacking the essential balance to earn a higher score.",Les Pommiers,89,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,EnRoute
US,"Pretty severe, an acidic, raspingly dry wine and even a tannic one. Shows an astringency rare in Chardonnay, even though there are some good pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Not an ager.",Searby Vineyard,85,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nickel & Nickel
US,"Too acidic and tart in wintergreen flavors, a real disappointment from this well-regarded vineyard. On the plus side, it's bone dry and silky, and shows cherry and cola flavors accented with sweet, smoky oak. Ready to drink now.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,85,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali

US,"Lots of zesty acidity in this Sauvignon Blanc, with pineapple and lemon jam flavors. It's a dry, tart and mouthwateringly fresh white wine, and a good apéritif sipper.",Bevill Vineyard,85,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hauck
US,"This is a big, full-bodied Pinot, dark in color, fairly tannic and weighty. Completely dry, it's made in a more robust style than many another Russian River Pinot Noir. The cherry, currant, pomegranate and persimmon flavors have an edge of raisins that adds interest. Decant it, let it breathe and watch how it changes in the glass.",Coopersmith,92,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Tight and aloof now, showing brawny tannins that accentuate the dryness, and the oak has not yet been integrated. But this is clearly a very fine wine. It's bone dry and silky and classically structured, with a deep, impressive core of berries and cola, as well as earthy, foresty mushrooms and balsam. Needs time. Give it a good six years in the cellar.",Olivet Lane,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards

US,"Subtle and shy at first, exhibiting light aromas of rose petal, this wine unveils slowly to reveal complex elements of cinnamon, red and black cherry—a curious commingling that comes together nicely.

US,"The fruit from this marquee site is elusive at first, offering light wisps of rose petal and bay, earthy and spicy in equal waves.

US,"This floral wine opens as if in a damp but not wet forest, surrounded by ripe, red cherry trees. Likable from the start, it's grippy on the palate, expressively juicy, seductive and refined. Blackberry and dried herb pop on the finish, providing a darker side to the red fruit.",Hallberg Vineyard,93,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Lots of acidity gives the cherry and raspberry flavors a sour candy tartness that makes the mouth water. The mouthfeel is light and silky, as you want in a Pinot Noir. It's a fine wine to drink now, with a good decanting, but try cellaring it for 5–6 years to see what kinds of earthy, mushroomy complexities emerge.",Ritchie Vineyard Cinder Cone,88,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Woodenhead

US,"So easy to like now for its ripe, pie-filling flavors of raspberries and cherries, cola, sweet rhubarb, cured meat, cinnamon and white pepper.

A good example of Russian River precision.",Special Reserve,90,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Herzog

The fruit detonates in the mouth, offering a flood of blackberries, black cherries, black raspberries and currants, with complex notes of unsweetened baker's chocolate and peppery Provençal herbs and lavender. May calm down with a few years in the bottle.",Don Miguel Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah-Tempranillo,Marimar Estate

US,"So dry, so crisply acidic, so silky in the mouth, and so rich in flavor. This is a truly distinctive Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's elusive personality, now rich in cherries and currants, withdrawing into minerals and herbs. Yet the final impression is of fine, silky decadence.

US,"Delicately floral in aroma, this soft, earthy Pinot offers blue and red berry fruit that are layered and generous on the finish. Food-friendly, it has the heft to stand up to bigger, bolder flavors on the plate or suffice as a sipping wine on its own.",,89,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kobler
US,"A pure and distinctive fruit flavor, like a blend of rhubarb and blackberry, distinguishes this full-bodied but elegant and velvet-textured wine. There is little or no new oak influence to get in the way of the melody of the grapes themselves. While the wine is lush and broad in mouthfeel, a nice boost of fine tannins and fresh acidity keep it lively.",,92,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sanglier Cellars
US,"Burning hot in alcohol, this Zin is totally dry. It has peppery flavors of shriveled grapes and currants, with a bitter mouthfeel.",E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate,82,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"Rich and silky, but a little heavy and soft. The polished cherry, raspberry, red currant, cola and bacon flavors are delicious, even complex, with an array of spices, and there's a lovely mouthfeel of silk and satin. But there's a certain direct quality. Drink now.",Jenkins Vineyard,87,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A bit over the top in fruity extraction, a bomb blast of sweet raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. It's almost like a dessert wine. Yet there's a lot of tannins and acidity, and who knows? It could do interesting things. At this price, buy a bottle and stick it in the cellar for six years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,87,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Good, rich and spicy Zin from Williams Selyem winemaker Bob Cabral. It's not the most memorable Bacigalupi ever, with a somewhat soft, simple structure. But the raspberry, vanilla, toast and spice flavors are fine for drinking now.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Quite a good Zinfandel, although it does show some of the weaknesses that strike this vineyard in a cool year. You'll find a smooth, full-bodied wine, with ample tannins and fine berry-cherry fruit and spices. Yet it's curiously ambiguous in the mouth, and the concentration falls apart midpalate.",Forchini Vineyard North Flats,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Here's a rich, spicy Pinot Noir for drinking now. Dry and silky, it has plenty of ripe raspberry, cherry, cola and rhubarb fruit, with a good application of sweetly toasted oak. Could be a little crisper, which limits ageworthiness.",,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"High alcohol, massively ripe fruit that's slightly overripe and sweetness in the finish mark this robust Zin. Not for everyone, but it has a varietal purity that Zinfanatics will love.",Heritage Vines Alegría Vineyards,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Acorn
US,"This particular bottling by the fine Patz & Hall winery often seems too ripe and oaky. The '09 exhibits these issues. It's fantastically rich in tangerine, apricot, pear and peach flavors, and while the new oak is only 40%, it dominates for some reason in the form of sweet butterscotch and vanilla cream. Delicious and impressive, but lacks subtlety in favor of power.",Zio Tony Ranch,87,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"From an estate vineyard off Olivet Lane in the heart of the Santa Rosa Plain, this wine is comparatively intense and meaty compared to some of its counterparts from the cooler Sebastopol Hills. Earthy mushroom and a tart, tangy note of orange give it a lift, along with a light layering of fresh-cut rose, before finishing in richer, dark chocolate.",BCD Vineyard,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"One of the producer's larger-production offerings, this wine nonetheless speaks to meticulous attention in the vineyard and cellar, with velvety smoothness to the palate and savory elements of earthy mushroom. Nuanced, it ends in rose petals and black tea, with firm, crisp acidity throughout, all at an almost unheard-of price for the quality.",,91,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"From two vineyard sites, Martaella and Martinelli Frei Road, this lovely wine is built from the ground up, with elements of rich vanilla, toasted oak and baked pear. Big in style on the nose, it finishes crisp and focused, a mixture of complexity and lightness of being.",,91,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Benovia
US,"Perfumed in violet and rose, this wine is spicy in clove and nutmeg, a savory sneak that undermines the bright, high-toned cherry and berry in deliciously devious ways. Medium bodied with a tannic bite on the finish, it offers the best of both worlds in terms of elegance and oomph.",Floodgate Vineyard,91,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
US,"Feels hot and Porty in the mouth, although it's very dry, with bitter raisinskin and shriveled cherry flavors. The alcohol approaches 16%.",Reserve,81,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years.",Five Sisters,97,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has flavors of candied orange, peach and tropical fruit. A brisk hit of acidity provides much-needed balance.",,84,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Picket Fence
US,"Light and perfumed, this is a structured, well-crafted wine that's slightly savage in approach and sensibility. Spicy cinnamon and cola streak through red cherry and strawberry, flirting with the notion of forest and mushroom without ever diving overly deep.",,91,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,The Calling

US,"This is a wonderfully rich, seductive Pinot Noir. It has the lushness and complexity you want in a fine California bottling, with a silky texture and crisp acidity. The flavors are very complex, ranging from raspberry and cherry tart, cola and exotic rosehip tea to sandalwood, finishing with a flourish of spice. Lots of new oak, but it's perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Tina Marie Vineyard,94,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
US,"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. A scour of minerals gives the wine a steely grounding, while brilliant acidity makes the finish ultraclean. Really beautiful, a top Russian River Chardonnay at a fair price for the quality. The vineyard is in the cool Green Valley.",Ruxtan Vineyard,94,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lost Canyon
US,"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style. It's flashy in complex tiers of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and cinnamon spice, yet is silky and dry. The fruit comes from Sonoma Coast, Green Valley and the Middle Reach. An impressive followup to the inaugural '07, and a bottling to watch.",Les Pommiers,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,EnRoute
US,"A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with strong, but not heavy, flavors of strawberries and raspberries. There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure.",Rose of Pinot Noir,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Lynmar
US,"Lush in pineapple cream, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and apricot flavors, this Chardonnay is as rich as they come. There's also a welcome overlay of zesty, citrusy acidity.

The balance is exquisite, and the way the acids dance along the palate make the wine clean and lively.",Allen Vineyard,97,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts.",Drake Estate Vineyard,96,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"The acidity really makes this Chardonnay come alive, providing vitality, a quality that's boosted by an undercurrent of minerals. It's so rich in tropical fruit, orange, nectarine and pear flavors, and so generously oaked, which brings a sweet, satisfying note of buttered toast, that all you want to do is drink it now, preferably with steamed lobster and melted butter.",Heintz Vineyard,96,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem

US,"Opulence, lushness and a silky, seductive texture are what you expect from Pinot Noir, and this one delivers them all. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with subtle, complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, red currants, licorice, bacon and peppery spices. Easy to drink from the get-go, and gets more interesting as it warms in the glass.",,93,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Of The Place
US,"Grown in the very cool central-southwestern part of the appellation, by Sebastopol, this Pinot features crisp, mouthwatering acidity. And, in this wonderfully long hangtime vintage, its flavors are extraordinarily rich and pure, brimming with cherries and raspberries. It shows layers of complexity, yet is too young, with the parts unintegrated. Give it 4–5 years in a cool cellar.",Jenkins Vineyard,93,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, although it's a bit brusque in acidity. Still, it's enormously rich and dry, with long-lasting flavors of raspberry tart and cherry-cinnamon granola. Give it a brief decant, and drink with rich, umami-inspired fare, like teriaki salmon or cured meats.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"This Pinot is gigantic in raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, and its silky texture and crisp acidity make it particularly drinkable. On the other hand, it's rather forward and one-dimensional. Give it a good, long decant, and you might even want to pour the glasses an hour before drinking. Now–2015.",Floodgate Vineyard,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Cartograph

US,"Beautiful and likeable for its dryness, crisp minerality, and the sleek, clean mouthfeel. The fruit suggests oak-inspired pears, oranges and citrons. This elegant quaff gets better as it warms in the glass. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Tastes sharp and jammy, a very young wine with fresh flavors of cherries and black raspberries. Gets the Pinot job done at a decent price, and could mellow in the bottle through 2011.",Estate Vineyards,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rodney Strong
US,"While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,96,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018.",Williams Selyem Estate Vineyard,95,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The pedigree of this rich Pinot Noir is evident right away in the mouthfeel, offering a silky and satiny texture, brightened with citrusy acidity. The flavors immediately kick in with a solid wall of red cherries, licorice, persimmons, pomegranates and cola. An exciting, complex wine to drink now, and it should gather momentum over six years, maybe even longer.",Olivet Lane,95,62,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This shows Merry Edwards' signature of exceptional deliciousness and drinkability, coupled with seemingly neverending depth. Made using fruit sourced from the winery's vineyard in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, this is rich in acids and soft tannins, but the flavors set it apart. Notes of raspberry, cherry, cola, tea, licorice, pepper and sandalwood abound and evolve with every sip. Drink now–2018.",Coopersmith,95,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"For sheer voluptuous pleasure, this is one of Williams Sel-yem's best 2010s. It just floods the mouth with flavors of raspberry and cherry Pop-Tarts, with the most wonderful array of spices and a tender use of oak. Hard to keep from drinking it now, but it should age well over the next 8–10 years.",Bucher Vineyard,95,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Somewhat aloof now, this has grippy tannins that lock down the palate. Underneath the grip are complex flavors of juicy blackberry, plum sauce and exotic spice, with brooding earthy notes and sweet, smoky oak tones. Very fine, but one for the cellar. Give it at least 6–8 years, and it could easily go for another decade beyond that, gradually becoming more delicate, supple and complex.",Allen Vineyard,94,82,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"An ultrarich Pinot Noir, this is dense and full bodied, with flavors of cherry pie, chocolate, cherry liqueur, graham cracker, spice and sandalwood. Most notable is its weight and the way the wine takes over the palate and lasts through the impressively long finish. Fine now with rich fare, like lamb and steak, and it should also develop in the bottle for 6–8 years.",Katherine Lindsay Estate Cuvee Agustina,94,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Paul Hobbs
US,"Yes, it's gigantic in alcohol. But it's dry, creamy-smooth and softly delicious, with palate-caressing flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, mocha, cinnamon and pepper. Very nice by itself and will lift up short ribs or BBQ.",Bacchi Vineyard Old Vine,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis
US,"From the Laguna Ridge neighborhood of the larger appellation, this is a subtle, fuller-bodied wine that's silky and refined in dark cherry, anise and rich earth. Pomegranate and cassis play in the background, the flavors nuanced and complex, with a tangy, citrus-tinged finish.",Martaella Vineyard,91,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Grassy lime, kiwi and crème brûlée provide succulence and substance to this wine, surrounded refreshingly by ebullient acidity. Fermented in stainless steel, it was then aged minimally in neutral French oak. The wood provides firm structure without getting in the way of the fruit.",River Road Ranch,91,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Trione
US,"With a taste of white sugar and honey, this Chardonnay can't really be described as dry. But it is clean and vibrant in acidity, with rich pineapple jam and green apple flavors, and the underlying tang of minerals helps to ground it.",Proprietor's Reserve,86,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rutz
US,"Another in a string of fine Pinots from this producer. Shows real cool coastal influence in the brisk acidity, delicate structure and deep flavors of cherries and cola, which seem to have a long hangtime complexity. Very good, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.",,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz

US,"Shows the massively extracted raspberry, cherry, cola and anise flavors this block of the estate vineyard produces, with rich oak influences. No denying the opulence and immediately decadent appeal, or the silky, tapestry-like texture. Seems off a bit from the fabulous 2007, a little fatter, hotter and more obvious, but still a very flamboyant Pinot Noir. Drink now–2013.",Bliss Block,91,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A wonderful Gewürz. You never know what to expect from this varietal, but in this case the wine is basically dry, and freshly crisp in acidity. The flavors are complex, ranging from oranges, pineapples and honeysuckle to star anise, toffee and the famous spices of Gewürztraminer. There's also a rich, creamy texture.",,91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Novy
US,"Made in an immediately appealing style, this Pinot has forward raspberry and strawberry jam, cherry pie, Dr. Pepper, vanilla custard and smoky sweet oak flavors. It's so delicious, you hardly notice the tannin and acid firmness. But that will protect it and enable it to age for 6–8 years.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Fruity and oaky, this Chardonnay is made in the modern California style of immediate palate appeal. It's not especially complex or ageworthy, but has crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple tart, crème brûlée and vanilla cookies.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Athair
US,"Crisp and citrusy. Treads predictable grounds for California Sauvignon Blanc, but in a superior way. Flatters with pineapple and Meyer lemon flavors that are ultraclean and racy.",,86,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"Shows a certain aggressiveness, offering up vibrant raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, mocha and oak flavors, but kept aloof by its acidity and tannins. It's certainly elegant and pedigreed, but it need 3–4 years in the cellar.",Georganne,93,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is currently very dry and austere due to its tannins, but it's impressive for its noble structure and deep, complex flavors of blackberries, cranberries, brown sugar and spices.- With such depth and a long finish, it's clearly a cellar candidate. Don't even think about opening it until 2017, at least.",Rochioli Vineyard,93,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Rich, balanced and full bodied, this shows exuberantly ripe, sweet flavors of blackberries, mulberries, dark chocolate and raisins, with notes of exotic spices. It will last for 20 years, gradually losing fruit and growing earthy and mushroomy.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Earthy in a way that's almost savage, this wine's bouquet discloses layers of cooked mushroom and forest floor, the texture velvety smooth.

The finish shows some of the oak.",,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Migration
US,"Rich and ripe, this has flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and red currants, plus layers of exotic spices and toasty sandal-wood that change with every sniff and sip.

US,"Soft yet tannic, this has a brooding quality that suggests it will benefit from some time in the cellar. It shows elaborate flavors of blackberries, plums and cola, with earthy notes of mushrooms and mulch.

US,"Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there. It needs a year or so in the bottle to emerge, and even a brief decant will bring greater harmony to this expressively opulent wine.",La Sereinité,91,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"This is tight, tannic and distinguished, yet it shows a sweet, toasted oak touch, with ripe, tart flavors of red cherries, red currants and persimmons, plus accents of red licorice and cola. Beautiful now with decanting, and should glide through the next 10 years.",Hallberg Vineyard Dijon Clones,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell

US,"If this wine, made from some of the valley's best vineyards, were drier, it would be a sensation. As it is, it's very fine, with crisp acidity framing ripe, bold flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons and Key limes. Oak adds richer notes of vanilla, buttered toast and smoky meringue. The sweetly honeyed finish is a little simple.",,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Merry Edwards

US,"Leathery on the palate with sizably structured tannins, this estate-grown wine is robust in black cherry and blackberry, sprinkled subtly in black pepper, tar and coffee.

US,"A little too sweet for comfort, with jammy orange, apricot and lime flavors. Brisk acidity and a savory minerality help restore balance, but the score would be higher if the finish were drier.",,86,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Zina Hyde Cunningham
US,"A bit raw and scoury in the mouth, with some green, minty sharpness to the cherry, spice and smoky oak flavors. The palate wants to like this wine, but that sharpness keeps on intruding on the pleasure.",Maboroshi Vineyard,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutcher Crossing
US,"This is the least expensive of the winery's four new 2010 Syrahs, and it's the most approachable. With fine, supple tannins and a dry finish, it shows flavors of rich blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate, anise and pepper, which are enhanced with sweet oak. Only 122 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,MacLaren
US,"Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish. Polished and crisp, it has flavors of raspberries, cherries, tart cranberries and ripe pomegranates. The fruit is sourced from the cool, southern part of the Russian River Valley.",Baranoff Vineyard,92,71,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"Here's a dry, silky, elegant young Pinot Noir for drinking now. It doesn't have the concentration and depth of J's more expensive wines, but approximates them. Shows pleasant cherry, cola and cedar flavors.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Very ripe, soft and fruity, basically a jammy bomb, with pepper-infused grilled blackberry, black cherry and mulberry flavors, complexed with interesting balsam, chocolate and molasses notes. The tannins are thick and decisive. Should have a smooth transition over the next six years.",50 Vine Age Series,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,XYZin
US,"There's a reductive element to the nose of this wine, indicating the powerful nature of the vintage but also the wine's youth. Let it open to unveil an intensity of baked apple and white peach, along with heartier highlights of crème brûlée and vanilla toast. With a medium body and length, it has enough acidity to remain vibrant. It's sourced from a who's who of the region's vineyards.",Russian River Selection,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"From a vineyard site farmed by the Duttons called Matthew's Station, this is a gentle wine, medium in weight, with nuances of green apple and fresh-squeezed lemon. Balanced, it offers a twist of toffee and oak beneath its crisper notes, finishing warm in nutmeg and ginger spice.",,90,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,MacRostie

US,"A decent Pinot, but a bit funky and sharp. Although this Pinot has jammy raspberry flavors, the mouthfeel is awkward, and the finish is simple and sweet. Disappointing from this prestigious winery.",Russian River Selection,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Too sharp in texture, with a cut of acidity that emphasizes the white pepper, and seems to bring out some greenness. Other than that, you'll find a smoothly tannic wine, with blackberry and currant fruit.",Axiom Alegría Vineyards,86,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"Made in a lighter style, this wine is nonetheless rich and complex in flavor, proving that Pinot Noir doesn't have to be heavy to be really good.

US,"An extravagant Chardonnay, rich in buttered toast and vanilla cream from oak barrels, and opulent fruit flavors of ripe, sweet pineapples, golden mangoes and pears.

US,"This bone-dry, full-bodied Syrah has firm tannins and intense concentration. It's a little warm in alcohol, with flavors of dark chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, grilled bacon and black pepper, plus a coating of sweet, smoky oak. You might want to give this wine a year or so in the cellar to let everything meld together.",Samantha's Vineyard,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,MacLaren

US,"This has a squeeze of lime-like acidity that cuts across the broad, rich cherry-pie, red licorice and spicy sandalwood flavors, which come with a touch of funky leather. For all of that fruit, it has a remarkably delicate mouthfeel, and it finishes dry and clean. It's very hard to predict this wine's future, but it's beautiful now to drink after a few hours in the decanter, and it should be fine over the next four years.",Katherine Lindsay Estate,91,85,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Paul Hobbs
US,"Here's an expressive, savory Pinot Noir for drinking young. Dry and crisp, this has pretty flavors of raspberry, cherry, gingersnap and sandalwood flavors.

Now–2013.",Ceremonial,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"This Syrah remains tough and gritty in tannins, with a lockdown astringency that gets in between the cherry, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors and your enjoyment of them. It's very dry and crisp in acidity, and seems to have the inherent balance to mellow with 4–6 years in the cellar. Give it a try.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,88,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield

US,"The ripeness of the grapes ran away in this wine, so that despite high alcohol, it still retains what tastes like residual sugar. The result is an excessively sweet wine. It's almost like a minor Port.",Zeigler Vineyard,84,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is a very fruity-rich Zinfandel. It pushes the envelope on power and almost goes over the top, but wisely stops short in favor of balance, with acids and tannins providing needed finishing structure. The flavors are big and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries, blackberries, plums and chocolate, not to mention huge spiciness. Perfect with short ribs of beef.",Papera Ranch Vineyard,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy

US,"Clumsy, with outsized acidity and sweet, jammy raspberry, orange and cherry flavors. Tastes sweet and sour, like a Chinese pork sauce. Contains too many different varieties to list, but they include Muscat.",Medley Alegría Vineyards,84,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Acorn

US,"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast.

It's a blend of several vineyards from which the winery sources fruit.",Eastside Road Neighbors,90,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"If there's any oak on this wine, it doesn't show. What does show up is crisply clean acidity and brilliantly ripe pineapple, lime and honeysuckle flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. It's a lovely cocktail sipper, and nice with bruschetta and olive or mushroom tapenade.",,88,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Angeline

US,"A Russian River interpretation of a Rhône blend, this is made from Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne. It's dry and marked by zesty acidity and just a hint of oak.

US,"This is great Zinfandel. The vineyard was planted in 1915 and probably contains other varieties than Zinfandel. Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice. Has the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with smooth tannins and fine acidity. Zinfandel hardly gets any better than this.",Crow Ridge Vineyard,95,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,V. Sattui

Easy to drink on its own.",Grandview Vineyard,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Paradise Ridge
US,"Tart acidity marks this wine, giving it a tingly palate feeling. But that could go away by summer 2010, when the wine will be fully available.

US,"Soft and fruity, with raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper and oak flavors. It has the jammy, marmalade taste of freshly crushed berries, with citrusy acidity. The oak is front and center. Might develop with a few years in the bottle.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Waits-Mast
US,"As weighty as a Chardonnay, this is a Sauvignon Blanc whose nuances will be killed if you over-chill it. You could even decant it for a while and let it approach room temperature.

The wine feels clean, vibrant and smooth.",Cuvée 20 Brut,90,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"A bit too tannic and acidic, with a hard edge that interferes with the palate's enjoyment of the pure, refined raspberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. A good, distinguished Pinot, but lacks voluptuousness due to the coarseness. Drink now.",,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey

US,"This big, full-bodied Pinot leaves little to the imagination. It assaults the palate with massive fruit, spice and cedar flavors that sink down into the tongue and last long on the finish.

US,"A great success for this bottling. With extraordinarily high residual sugar, the wine is very sweet in wild honey, infused with the essence of oranges and apricots, folded into rich, buttery custard, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar and cinnamon.

US,"Williams  Selyem's track record with this bottling is excellent. While this 2012 has notes of raisins, they're more of a seasoning than the main ingredient.

US,"A textbook Pinot Noir for drinking now. Showing the variety's lighter side, it's savory in raspberry, cola and spice flavors, brightened with brisk acidity. Yet there's enough complexity to make it interesting.",Clone 777,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,William Knuttel
US,"Lots of zesty acidity in this Pinot Noir, giving the pomegranate, rhubarb, red cherry and licorice flavors a bright edge. The wine is very dry and complexly layered. Interesting now, if a bit primary in fruit, and balanced enough to develop additional nuances over the next six years.",Mononi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"The wine is a blend of several vineyards in the Green Valley. It shows its cool origins in the brisk acidity and tannins, and the overall delicacy, so balanced and refined in the mouth. Bone dry and zesty, it conveys intricate flavors of cranberries, cola, persimmons and red cherries. It's beautiful now, and should develop well through at least 2020.",Les Pommiers,92,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,EnRoute

US,"Gorgeous and delicious, this low-production bottling is a best-of-barrels selection named for Marimar Torres's daughter. It's an exceptional wine that's compelling not only for its vivacity but also its complexity.

Delicious and compelling. Only 126 cases produced.",Widdoes Vineyard,95,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",O'Neel Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards

Really textbook Zin, dry, lively and distinctive. Drink now-2013.",Karma Zin Rue Vineyard Old Vine,91,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Carol Shelton
US,"This is a classically light rosé, fragrant in strawberry and raspberry. Traces of pomegranate on the back palate offers darker, riper fruit in the glass, getting prettier as it goes along. Deliciously dry and dancing in acidity, it has plenty of citrus on the finish. The wine is substantial enough for springtime and summertime meals, but will drink equally well on its own.",Rosé of,92,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar

US,"This bottling is now past its initial blush of youth and is entering its middle period. The cherry and pomegranate fruit is drying, turning more interesting and complex, with spicy, mushroomy complexities. Even the color is changing toward rust. Swan Pinots live for a very long time, and this one is just getting started.",Saralee's Vineyard,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir notable for sheer lusciousness, which is partly due to high alcohol.

US,"At two-plus years this Pinot Noir still is an infant. It's a swirl of new toasty oak, ripe cherries and currants, acidity and fresh, chunky tannins. It's a pity that much of it will be opened too young. Should be more harmonious toward the end of 2009, and evolve for many years after.",Trenton Estate,92,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"If you open this bottle before late 2009, you'll find a tightly wound wine marked by acidity and tannins. In other words, not showing its best. Inside the structure is remarkably ripe fruit, along the lines of cherries, currants, pomegranates and cola.

US,"Tasted in December, this Pinot was going through an awkward phase. It's like the cherry and currant fruit, new oak, acids and tannins are groping for each other in a dark room. Need time to show its complexity, and should begin to resolve well into 2009.",Great Oak Vineyard,92,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards

Low alcohol gives it perfect balance.",DCV 10,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"A vigorous wine. In its youth it's bright and jammy in raspberries, cherries and currants, with fine, silky tannins and citrusy acidity, like a squeeze of lime. There's oak here, too.

US,"Good price for a Zin this complex, from a well-regarded vineyard. The wine has wild berry, herb, currant, coffee, mineral and spice flavors.

Drink now–2020.",Carlisle Vineyard,90,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy

US,"What's so interesting about this wine is the savory minerality, racy acidity and extreme dryness that make it completely different from 99% of the Sauvignon Blancs in California.

Should develop through 2013.",Estate Bottled,89,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto

US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",Heintz Vineyard,96,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem

US,"Good and complex, but smells a little candied, like mint cherry-scented toothpaste, and tastes sweetly jammy in cherries. This all-Pommard clone Pinot may be going through a mute phase. Try holding for several months.",Earthquake Block Don Miguel Vineyard,88,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"So silky and light, you might think it's a Pinot Noir. Rich in spicy red currant, mocha, cinnamon spice and oak flavors, it's a smoothly elegant wine, made for drinking now.",,88,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sonoma Cuvée
US,"A fine Sauvignon Blanc that's considerably richer than the '06. Shows green apple, citrus, fig, vanilla and pepper flavors and a crisp, clean mouthfeel. The oak influence has been kept to a minimum, allowing the fruit to shine.",,88,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Longboard
US,"This is a really drinkable Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky and crisp, and the flavors are enormously rich, suggesting ripe cherries, raspberries and blackberries baked into a pie. Drink now.",Estate Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Crinella
US,"This is a very serious Pinot Noir, one that will benefit from cellaring despite the drink-me-now deliciousness. It's not just the fruit, which is deeply satisfying in cherries, raspberries, sweet rhubarb pie, blood oranges and juicy pomegranates. It's the structure. Crisp acids and silky tannins create a near-perfect architecture. Elegant and sophisticated, this wine should develop additional complexities for at least six years, with proper cellaring.",Arrendell Vineyard,95,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"This one's a prime example of how fat overripeness is yielding to a leaner balance and elegance. Not that there's anything austere about this luscious Chard, with its white apricot, citron, guava and mineral flavors. It's a terrific wine and showcases Hartford Court at its best.",Three Jacks Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"The winery's Saralee's bottling has been variable over the years. The '06 is tasty and eminently drinkable if you want a nice, dry, crisp Pinot. It's pale in color, silky in the mouth, and direct in cherry, cola, spice and oaky flavors. Drink now.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Oaky and direct in ripe tropical fruit, with a gooseberry taste more akin to Sauvignon Blanc, this Chard is unripe and simple.",Special Reserve,81,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Michael Pozzan
US,"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences.",Unoaked,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Packs plenty of punch into an inexpensive, everyday Chardonnay. With brisk, tangy acidity, it offers rich, appealing flavors of pineapples, green apples, vanilla and sweet, creamy butter.",Discovery,87,11,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Q
US,"Give this wine until 2020 in the cellar to let all the parts begin to come together. Tasted in March, it's all about tannins, unintegrated oak and fresh, ripe raspberry jam fruit. There's a good wine in there somewhere but it's hiding right now.",,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bruliam
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, lilting, refined and utterly delicious. Testarossa stumbled with the '04, but otherwise their track record is great, and the '06 is right up there with the marvelous '05 and '03. The wine's cherry, licorice and smoky oak flavors are captured in a rewarding texture of silk and satin.",Fritschen Vineyard,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"With a generous bite of acidity, this fine Chardonnay is extremely flavorful. Traditionally one of the winery's top Chards, it's explosive in pineapple, Asian pear, crème brûlée and roasted marshmallow flavors. Finishes in a swirl of creamy, buttery spices.",Heintz Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Here's a young, hedonistic Pinot that captures the essence of RRV from a perfect vintage. Although it's ripely forward in cherry, pomegranate, Dr. Pepper, red licorice and cinnamon spice flavors, it shows a structural sophistication that elevates the score. Beautiful now, and should improve over the next 6 years.",Longbow,93,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Winemaker Steve Goldfield brings the same deft touch he displays with Pinot Noir to this lush, elegant wine. It has the structure of a gentle Merlot, but with the wild cherry and raspberry, date nut cake, cocoa, pepper and clove flavors that make it so distinctive and savory. This is consistently one of the best Zins from the RRV.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"An interesting and challenging wine. Shows some funky, mushroomy notes, along with flavors of cherries, cola, rhubarb and green tomato jam, accompanied by high acidity. It's Burgundian, in its own way, and could develop in the bottle. Now–2014.",,89,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Terlato
US,"This beautiful Pinot Noir drinks well now because it's so fruity, delicately structured and crisp. Shows oak-inspired and refined raspberry, cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors that finish in a rich swirl of exotic spices. Has the inherent balance to develop through at least 2014.",The Whitewing Amber Ridge,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
US,"Very fine and complex. This deeply flavored Pinot Noir is powerful, but it's also elegantly silky, which is the magic combination. Shows perfectly ripe cherry and raspberry fruit, with gorgeous overtones of oak and spices. Beautiful now, and will age well through 2014 or so.",Nugent Vineyard,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir. Plays in the major leagues, with its refined texture and complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice and sandalwood, with a long, spicy finish. The most notable feature is the structure. Feels so lush and fine, so delectable, so dramatic. This is one of the best Pinots available for drinking now.",,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
US,"From a vineyard in the Green Valley, it has ripe flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, pears and Meyer lemons, with lots of smoky, honeyed notes of new French oak. Not very subtle, it will appeal to fans of oaky, ripe Chardonnay.",Stiling Vineyard,88,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nickel & Nickel
US,"With a funky note suggesting sweaty leather, this Pinot might be called Burgundian. It's dry and silky but complex, with a range of cherry pie filling, pomegranate, cola, tangerine zest, vanilla and smoky oak flavors. Best now.",Rod's Pride Goldie's Vines,87,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Toad Hollow
US,"A good, serviceable expression of a Russian River Pinot that's ready to drink now. Dry and crisp, it shows oak-infused flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and mocha.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Cuvée
US,"From the southern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, comes this young, juicy, crisp Pinot. It's marked by fruit. The freshly crushed flavors of ripe raspberries and cherries are enormously attractive, accented with toasty oak and Asian spices. But the wine has a youthful, acidic tightness that suggests aging. Best now, with decanting, and for six years.",Jennifer's,92,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"With residual sugar of 22.4%, this dessert wine has fantastically sweet flavors of apricot jam, tangerine marmalade, gingersnap cookie, vanilla and crème brûlée, balanced with crisp acidity. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 9.8%.",Saralee's Vineyard Cluster Select Late Harvest,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Williams Selyem
US,"In a sea of mediocre Merlots, Longboard's '06 stands out. It's not only deliciously ripe and generous in blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice, cola and mocha flavors, but the structure of fine acidity and smooth, elegant tannins makes it delectable.",DaKine Vineyard,91,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard
US,"This bottling from esteemed producer Williams Selyem is a rich, concentrated wine, brimming with savory flavors of wild cherries and raspberries, red currants, milk chocolate, cloves and black pepper. The extraordinary tannins are smooth and as fine as velvet.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem

US,"This is Martin Ray's best non-reserve Chard in years. In fact, it's as good as some of their reserves. It shows real richness, with fancy oak and lees influences and complex the peach and pear fruit flavors.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"This bottling continues to impress after all these years with its complexity and sheer deliciousness. The '06 shows charred barrel fermentation notes of pungent, smoky wood, but there's a great heart of citrus, melon and pepper spice flavors that makes the wine rich and rewarding. It's made even better by zesty acidity and a bone-dry finish.",La Petite Etoile,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean

US,"Volume is what this Zin is all about. The vineyard is in the warmest part of the valley, and the grapes sure did get ripe. They flood the mouth with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice and red plums, with a peppery, briary quality and a finish so softly sweet, it's almost chocolaty. Just yummy.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"A little soft and lacking in crisp vibrancy, but there's plenty of spearmint chewing gum, pineapple jam and golden mango flavors. The wine, which was unoaked, finishes a little sweet.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"A rich, direct Chard that leaves little to the imagination. It offers a sunburst of oak-inspired tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe and jammy, in the modern California style.",Orsi Vineyard,86,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,C. Donatiello
US,"A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance.",Keefer Ranch,85,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Novy
US,"You'll want to give this pretty Pinot some time in the bottle, to let it mellow out. Right now, it's a big-boned wine, with flamboyant raspberry, cherry and sassafras flavors of the pie-filling kind, and a smoky, vanilla edge of oak. Despite the volume, the wine is dry and elegant, with a rich scour of cleansing acidity. Best after winter 2007.",Fritschen Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"This bottling has been remarkably consistent over the last several vintages. Always exotic in lemondrop-candy fruit that's been well-oaked, it has nuances of flower petals, white peaches, minerals and honey. The '06 may be a little softer than past vintages.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"One hundred percent new French oak is the dominant theme here. It floods the mouth with the flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. The oak influence is strong, but the underlying wine has some equally strong pineapple, mango and apple fruit. It's made in a rich California style you either love or hate.",,91,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Parallel
US,"This is a good Pinot Noir for drinking now. It has uncomplicated flavors of cherries, red plums and spices, and is dry and silky in the mouth. Acidity is high, giving it a tart bite throughout.",,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Athair
US,"A good, complex, full-bodied Syrah, with some toughness in the texture and a minty note that's less than ripe. Bigtime tannins and extreme dryness call for well-marbled beef to coax out its best.",Alegria Vineyard,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"Off a pace or two from the '05, but still shows plenty of ripe, fruity flavor. The jammy cherries and blackberries have rich notes of orange zest, licorice and smoky vanilla.",Estate,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Balletto
US,"Shows the fine varietal characteristics of dryness, silkiness and fruitiness you want in a nice Russian River Pinot, with suggestions of cherries, currants, root beer and smoky oak. There's also a streak of wintergreen tartness that seems to limit the cellar-worthiness. Best now and through 2010.",,86,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,C. Donatiello
US,"This is a blend of some of the winery's best vineyards. The '06 is quite a good wine, but showcases some of the limitations of the vintage. Structurally, it's fine, with a good acid-tannin balance, but it could be more concentrated. The cherry and currant flavors are a little unfocused.",Westside Road Neighbors,89,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",Director's Cut,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"A little obvious in its appeal to our liking for oak and ripe fruit. Who can criticize the pineapples, citrons, tangerines and green apples, with their overlay of caramel and buttered toast? Rich as it is, you find yourself wishing it were more subtle and nuanced. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch,87,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"The fruit is front and center on this oak-free Chardonnay. It's enormously rich in apricots, tangerines, pineapples, pears and lemons, with brisk acidity and a tang of minerals.",Unoaked,88,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit.",Reserve,85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"A very interesting wine that clearly shows its cool-climate origins, with a great big burst of brisk acidity that gets the tastebuds whistling. Underneath are pure flavors of green apples and ripe kiwis. The oak is sizable, but perfect for this formula, adding delicious honey, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. This is the best J. Lynne Chard I've had.",,90,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,J. Lynne
US,"One of the palest rosés of the year in color, this blush isn't shy in flavor. It offers a sunburst of lemon chiffon pie, strawberry, raspberry and chutney flavors, and finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. This is a really excellent wine.",,90,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Fritz
US,"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",DaKine Vineyard,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.",Feeney Vineyard,89,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Here's a sweetly delicious young Pinot whose flavors are designed to please. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam, anise, cola, pepper and sandalwood notes, brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Windsor Sonoma
US,"You don't want to drink this wine now. It's way too tannic, which also accentuates the acidity. It all makes for a tough palate experience, despite rich raspberry, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. So stash this vastly interesting Pinot Noir in your cellar for 3–5 years. But if you can't, decant. Even overnight.",Westside Road Neighbors,91,67,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Break out the hors d'oeuvres for this tart young Pinot Grigio. It needs food to balance it out. The acid-backed flavors are savory, and include Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass and sweet butter. Try with delicious little fish and pork appetizers baked in phyllo.",,87,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Grigio,Terlato

US,"There's a Floodgate Vineyard in Anderson Valley that produces very nice Pinot Noirs, but this one says it's from Russian River Valley. This wine is average in quality. It has a fine, silky mouthfeel, with some good cherry flavors, but also a sharp, green touch of mint that's unlikely to age out.",Floodgate Vineyard Old Vines,85,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,C.

US,"Pretty good, but at this price, a bit heavy and over-extracted for a Pinot Noir, almost Grenache-like. The flavors are black peppery, with an underground stream of black cherries and oak, and the tannins close in on the finish.",Reserva,85,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Esterlina
US,"Give this fresh young Pinot a year to mellow. Right now, it's jammy in raspberries and cherries, with a citric sharpness. Needs brief time to knit together and become seamless.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"Swan's longtime winemaker, Rod Berglund, turns his Pinot-esque hand to Gewürztraminer with this well-crafted, aromatic young white wine.

With a fine burst of acidity, it provides plenty of drinking pleasure.",Un-Oaked,87,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"It shows ultrarich tannins and a flavor complexity ranging from briary wild blackberries and prunes to currants, nettles, sweet tea and softened cola. It's absolutely dry, despite or perhaps because of very high alcohol. The wine is unapologetic about that ripeness, instead asking only to be happily paired with barbecue.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy

US,"The vineyard is in a cool, southerly part of the valley. The wine is classically structured, with crisp acidity and a silky mouthfeel framing rich, dry flavors of cherries, root beer and oaky spices. It's a lovely young Pinot to drink now for its fleshy opulence.",Jane's Vineyard Reserve,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rodney Strong

US,"Most tasters loved the huge complexities of this ripe, dense young wine. They praised its massive cherry and cocoa flavors that flirt with overripeness, and the smooth, silky texture. Another taster, however, found it super-oaky and clumsy. Likely to soften and knit together with a few hours of decanting, or aging through 2007.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,93,69,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Made mainly from vineyards in Green Valley, the wine was barrel fermented and underwent complete malolactic fermentation. The French oak barrels were 50% new. This level of intervention was appropriate to the underlying wine, which is massive in tropical fruit, pear, fig and melon flavors. The result is complex and lush.",Dutton Ranch,94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield

US,"I think this wine has a future, but right now it's in one of those middle-aged funks. It's ripe in cherries, bright in acids, and smooth, but has a certain flatness.

US,"Dry, earthy and not showing a lot now, this closed wine needs decanting or a bit of bottle age to open up. Presently. a cloud of tannins is hiding ripe cherry, cola and tobacco flavors.

US,"When our tasting panel team tasted the '02 a few years ago, we found it heavy, but possibly a sleeper. The '03 is in the same vein. While it lacks a certain vibrancy and has tannic weight, the deeply flavored core of cherries is impressive and suggests mid-term aging.",Cristina Selection Don Miguel Vineyard,86,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"All of this is barrel-fermented, 45% in new French oak, and it shows in the toasty, nutty scents.

US,"More herbal than Three Corner. Tomatoes, rhubarb, cola, not quite ripe. Anise, cocoa powder. Dry, brittle. Showing its age, but interesting and layered.",West Block Reserve,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Pretty tannic still, and very dry, but with some deep red cherry flavors, this wine may benefit from a few more years, but it's not an ager. It shows an angular structure that will stand up well to beef or lamb.",Rochioli Vineyard Le Pinot,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"From a very big vintage, a wine still with plenty of cherry and blackberry fruit, and even some gritty tannins. Very dry, and a little awkward in texture. Probably at its best now.",Allen Vineyard,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"A polished, elegant and delicious Pinot. New, smoky oak frames ripe, jammy blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and orange flavors, with richer notes of chocolate, figs and grilled meat. Impeccably balanced with acidity, this wine should hold and develop over the next six years.",Mononi,94,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Failla has a great track record with this vineyard, which is source to many wineries. The '06 is fresh and vibrant, and needs a little time to develop. It shows classic balance, with rich tannins, crisp acidity and brilliantly ripe, oak-inspired flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola and currants. As delicious as it is now, it's nervous and tentative. Give it a few years to come around.",Keefer Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"A beautifully ripened Pinot Noir from a great vintage. Shows plush flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, blood oranges, cola and peppery spices that are wrapped into a rich, silky mouthfeel. This dry, complex wine is a joy to drink.",Dutton Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rutz
US,"Here's a textbook example of a warm vintage Russian River Pinot. It has the appellation's velvety richness and varietal typicity, while the heat made for perfect ripening. Brims with cherry jam, blueberry pie, orange marmalade, datenut bread and oaky flavors, all balanced with juicy acidity, and the finish is dry. At its best now–2008.",,93,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,HK Generations
US,"Completely barrel-fermented, and it shows in the wine's lavish oak, ample weight and rich, oily texture. It's nutty and leesy, and much less overtly fruity than the winery's Russian River bottling, instead focusing more on weight and texture.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Dried cherry, cedar-toast and cumin notes mark the nose of this Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvingon-Merlot blend. It has a decidedly Tuscan cast to its sour-cherry-and-leather profile, and finishes dry, even and long, with hints of chocolate and plenty of toasty oak.",Splendo Blendo 1,89,80,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,De Loach
US,"Reserved, but with lovely aromatics, this Zin has tart dark-berry fruit and a slight nuttiness. Quite structured, this will benefit from a couple of years of cellaring.",Gambogi Ranch,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"A fine, elegant Sauvignon Blanc, with ultraclean apple, citrus and floral notes. What's really nice about it is the crispness. It's as bright and as clean as stainless steel.",Poplar Vineyard,88,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Fritz
US,"Aromas of red berries with thyme and anise accents also show a whiff of acetone that bothered some tasters. After that, this wine is on very comfortable ground. Smooth and evenly textured, it has a balanced, even graceful quality often lacking in Zinfandels. Good length and mild pepper and spice mark the finish.",Estate Bottled,88,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Decidedly lighter in color and weight than the Barbieri Ranch wine, the Saitone shows a bouquet of tart cherries, strawberries and herbs. Anise-tarragon notes add interest on the textured palate. Closes with dry, talc-like tannins.",Saitone Ranch,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Deeper and darker than the Estate bottling, this shows black cherry, meat and leather nuances. It's sexy, but a touch hot as well. Offers depth and complexity, especially on the finish, where interesting chocolate notes emerge.",OFS,88,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Clean, dry and tart in acids, this is a minerally Chard with citrus and kiwi flavors. It has some oak that adds richness, but it's not really a rich wine. It's more of a streamlined, sleek sipper.",,85,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Belvedere
US,"A nice wine with real varietal character, a smooth mouthfeel, crisp acids and ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries and mocha. Try this as a first course leading up to the expensive stuff.",Angeline,86,10,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"Classic Russian River Pinot, made in a drink-me-now style. Light in body, it's fully dry, with a silky texture framing cherry, cola, pomegranate and sautéed Portobello mushrooms with a splash of balsamic. A hint of oaky toast adds complexity.",,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Made in a lighter, earthier style, but still showing plenty of class. It's dry and silky, with sour cherry candy and spice flavors. Good value for a Pinot of this elegance.",,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Magness
US,"Fairly big and full in the mouth, yet quite silky in texture, with supple tannins that softly frame flavors of cola, earth, raspberries and beets. Picks up dried-spice notes on the long finish.",Quail Hill Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"This is quite a mouthfilling Zin. From old vines, it's rich in flavor, with notes of blackberry jam, cassis, espresso, dark bitter chocolate and anise. It's on the soft side. A hefty amount of new French oak contributes sweet tannins and toast to this full-bodied, zesty wine.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is one of the first important 2005 Russian River Pinots to hit the market, and it's an exciting hint to this eagerly awaited vintage. It was a cool, long hangtime year, and this wine is amazingly rich and deep in chocolaty cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. For all that, the wine is dry, supple and delicately tannic, and seems to have a fine future.",Ewald Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Dark cherries, plums, olives and licorice, as well as an edgy, chemical note. Lean in style, the palate's mixed berry flavors have olive accents. Finishes long, with firm tannins and tart acidity.",Papera Ranch,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"A solid foundation of ripe dark-cherry fruit adds vanilla, toast and cinnamon accents that work to create a full bouquet and palate. This Pinot has character and complexity. Finishes long, with licorice and mineral elements playing off the dry cherry flavors. Editors' Choice.",Estate Bottled,87,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,The understated pear and pineapple flavors of this medium- weight Chardonnay have pleasant spice accents. It finishes stylishly with slightly tart pineapple and citrus notes.,,87,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"A little too porty and raisiny for my tastes. Drinking dry and somewhat tannic, although the alcohol is a modest 13.9 percent. Drink now.",Rochioli Vineyard Le Pinot,86,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"A bit too much cat pee for me, although the crisp dryness is appealing. Beyond that, you get ripe grapefruit, lemon peel and passion fruit flavors.",,84,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Fritz
US,"A lush Chardonnay marked by the integrated balance of all its parts, resulting in great harmony. It's very ripe in tropical fruits and quite oaky and leesy, but like the powerful gymnasts at Cirque du Soleil, all the performers work together as a troupe. Drink with rich, fancy fare, like lobster or scallops.",Dutton Ranch,92,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"This is a good Pinot Noir with some real complexity. It shows the way Russian River ripens the grapes to satisfying cola, cherry and pomegranate flavors, while preserving vital acidity. Drink this dry wine now for its delicate elegance.",,88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belvedere
US,"Quite different from Spelletich's Spotted Owl release, this wine has spiced green-apple aromas. While it's as rich in flavor as the other offering, the acidity is lower, so the wine seems softer and creamier.",Heroncroft Vineyard-Keefur Ranch,86,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Spelletich Cellars
US,"This wine has a flinty, minerally personality, with a full  overlay of toasty oak. Don't look for fat, blockbuster fruit here—the flavors tend toward lime and tangerine. The oak adds caramel, vanilla and smoky notes. It's supple in the mouth but closes strangely flat.",Family Vineyard Selection Del Rio Vineyard,84,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Louis M. Martini
US,"This selection of five barrels (each representing one of Fritz's five daughters) is still lively, thanks to crisp acids that artfully point up flavors of cola, earth and black cherries. Smoke and earth on the nose. Drink now–2010.",Five Sisters,89,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Too young now. The wine is tannic and acidic, with cherry-berry flavors. It's not really very interesting; instead it's kind of raw and dry. Maybe it will go someplace.",Jack Hill Vineyard,84,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Lots of toast, char and caramel in the aromas, then it turns somewhat heavy and soft, with stewed fruit and espresso flavors. This wine seems to have suffered from the heat.",Estate,84,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanna
US,"Drinking well now, with smoke and earth aromas that easily slide into cola, black cherry and plum flavors. Plump in the mouth, but with crisp acids that may take over in another few years. Drink up.",Reserve,89,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Drinks fairly heavy and flat for a Pinot, with cooked cherry and cola flavors. Needs more life.",Proprietor's Reserve,83,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Forchini
US,"A nice, crisp Sauvignon Blanc that rewards for the array of spearmint, lemon, lime and fig newton flavors. With a rich bite of citrusy acidity, it finishes with a dusting of Asian spices.",,87,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Ledson
US,"This is the winery's top Pinot, Our Finest Stuff. It's nice and dry, with crisp acidity and firm tannins framing cherry cola flavors, but it's not particularly complex or ageworthy. Needs greater force, power and concentration for a reserve bottling.",O.F.S.,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Made in the modern, ripe California stlyle, this Chardonnay offers immediately appealing flavors of pineapple jam, peach, lime, kiwi and vanilla oak. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Ready now for sheer richness.",,87,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Paul Wines
US,"This is a big, spicy, powerful Zinfandel that brims with berry, cherry, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. It's not particularly subtle, but slams into the palate like an asteroid from space. Calls for barbecue, pure and simple.",Allegria Vineyards Heritage Vines,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Acorn
US,"Taut and intensely structured, the compact smoke, lime, ginger and nut bouquet here hints at what's within. The mouth offers lime and chalk, vanilla and apples and a creamy yet firm mouthfeel—it's surprisingly full, with bright acidity. The dry, crisp finish with its spicy, toasty flavors has great length, again showing structure and refinement. Will be at its best in two-plus years. Cellar Selection.",Woolsey Road Vineyard,92,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"Full and focused, the nose of orange, crème brûlée and vanilla opens to a handsomely balanced palate of lively citrus, Granny Smith apple and vanilla cream flavors. Moderately plump and pleasing, good underlying acidity here keeps it elegant and maintains fine flavor definition. Butterscotch, lemon and spicy oak flavors mingle on the long finish.Top Value.",Goldfields Vineyard - Reserve,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Deep pineapple and orange fruit is wrapped in a deep, toasty oak envelope in this Russian River classic. There are complex nutty, leesy, burnt sugar and even vaguely meaty notes on the nose. These open to a big-bodied but earthy and stony palate where bright, citrusy fruit and vanilla accents also vie for attention. Tightly wound, the burnt-toast and mineral finish is long and tasty, with more vanilla, smoke and apple accents. Top Value.",,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dehlinger
US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",,91,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cakebread
US,"At 2,523 cases, this is fabled grower Rochioli's largest-production Chardonnay. The bouquet sings with complex roasted nut, pineapple, citrus, toast and banana aromas. Tart apple and anise flavors play off the sweet caramel and vanillin oak to create an elegant balance on the palate. Persistent fruit and smoky accents on the finish—it's hard to resist. Top Value.",Estate,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"A blend of half barrel-fermented wine with half tank-fermented, this is a ripe, fruit cocktail of a wine, blending tropical fruit with smoke, vanilla and citrus. Soft and easy to drink.",,89,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Simple and sweet, with cola and cherry cough medicine flavors. The sugary taste reprises on the finish.",Dutton Morelli Vineyard,82,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WillowBrook Cellars

US,"Fairly tannic, herbal, pale. Very thin, transparent in flavor. Used to be “delicious” (Tom Rochioli) but past its prime.",West Block,84,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"An intoxicating bouquet of clove, ripe orange, peach and melon promises a lot, but this wine delivers. The similarly heady palate of creamy, ripe tropical fruit is almost romantic, the richly textured mouthfeel full and lush. Finishes long in the same sensuous manner. Drink now for its exuberant fruit and voluptuous feel. Like Paul, his wines exude style and character.",,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paul Hobbs
US,"This appealing Chardonnay is the same wine that carried a reserve designation in prior vintages. It's lushly woven and has aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and peach. The fruit is rich but not overly sweet, and sports accents of cinnamon and allspice. This balanced, medium-weight wine finishes long and easy with a nice nuttiness. Top Value.",,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"Shows proper Chard character in the peach flavors, oaky overtones and creamy texture. Could use more concentration, though, as it's rather weak on the finish.",Reserve,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood
US,"Very dry. Fairly tannic. Tea, cola, cherry flavors. Has a heaviness and lack of subtlety. Drink now.",East Block,84,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"13.7% alcohol. Really past its prime. Showing its age in the dull, cherry, vanilla and oak aromas and flat, tart mouthfeel. Lovers of old Pinot will find it exciting.",Allen Vineyard,84,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Offers hints of the winery's great vineyard-designates, but seems overpriced for what you get. The wine is dry and crisp and fruity, with cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb, cola and cedar flavors. Drink through the next few years.",,87,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",Reserve,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Castle Rock
US,"Lots of sweet cherry fruit in this polished red wine, which also shows the char and cedary flavors of oak barrel aging. It's gentle in tannins and has enough acidity for balance. A nice, everyday wine that brings to mind well-sauced pasta dishes.",Alegria Vineyard,86,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Acorn
US,"This is a unique wine with an unusual and impressive bouquet of peach smoke, cocoa and hazelnut. Balanced but firm on the palate, it offers robust fruit and spice flavors and mint, toast and nut accents. There's even an intriguing kirsch-like cherry note in here. Full-bodied, it's a wine of real individual character that finishes dense, long and spicy.",Don Miguel Vineyard Dobles Lías,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Torres
US,"Four different clones are separately fermented and then blended to make this unique bottling. An expansive nose shows vibrant pineapple, peach, and orange fruit with lemondrop and butterscotch accents. It's rich and mouthfilling, like a bite of banana cream pie, and turns maybe a bit orangey-sweet. Shy on subtlety, it packs in a lot of juicy flavor.",Three Jacks Vineyard,89,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.",OFS,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Plump and soft, with flavors that closely echo those found in the Quail Hill Vineyard bottling: spice, beet, earth, cola and cherries. Not as big as the Quail Hill, and not as long on the finish, but an attractive, easy-to-drink Pinot for near-term consumption.",,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Angeline Pinots have been good over the years, offering solid varietal character at an everyday price. The '05 is better than the '04, cleaner and crisper, with cherry, cola and rosehip tea flavors folded into a delicately silky texture.",,86,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Angeline
US,"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",Cool Coastal Vineyards,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"The oak stands out, giving this Pinot a vanilla, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast dominance over the underlying cherry jam fruit. Although the texture is nice and silky, the wine itself feels simple, especially at this price.",Mill Station Road,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Paul Wines
US,"A fruity-oaky and rather simple Pinot Noir. Offers plenty of upfront cherry-berry and cola fruit, with a kiss of oak, wrapped into a silky texture.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Paul Wines
US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine. It's a decidedly candy-sweet combination of butterscotch, peach and nut flavors with a soft, round mouthfeel. The light orange finish is easy. If you have good friends who just don't like dry wines, this is a great one to serve them.",Reserve,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ledson
US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality. Has all the body and length you could want, if not quite all the balance and finesse.",Rochioli Vineyard,87,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Some very appealing apple, asian pear, mint, smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even, medium-weight wine. It has fine fruit-to-acid balance and offers apple-peach flavors with a mild but evident butterscotch element. The tangy oak that's present from the start shows most prominently on the spicy finish.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rudd
US,"This smooth wine has good balance, and a fairly full mouthfeel. Even on the palate, it shows a bit of both ends of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum—the crisp grassy, herb and grapefruit side and also fig, pear and melon as foundation.",,86,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Here's a rich, complex, savory Zin from the coolish south-central part of the valley. The vines were planted only in 2000, but the wine has the density of the old vine Zins that border the vineyard. The wild raspberry, coffee, cola and peppery spice flavors finish thoroughly dry, with rich tannins.",Eight Cousins Vineyard,90,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pellegrini
US,"Heavy, with blackberry and blueberry jam and pepper flavors wrapped into strong tannins. It's a dry, well-ripened wine, but needs greater liveliness and complexity, especially at this price.",Allegria Vineyards Axiom,85,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"The vineyard is in Fulton, a cool part of the southeastern valley heavily influenced by fog, and the vines are about 100 years old. This is great, classic Zinfandel. It should be in a museum. Despite high alcohol, it has a silky, Pinot-esque suppleness, balanced with crisp acids, and is profoundly rich in Zinny flavor. Currants, mushu plum sauce, anise, crushed black pepper, dark chocolate and rich Asian spices last forever on the finish.",Highwire Vineyard,96,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hartford
US,"Made in the Merry Edwards style, which is powerfully ripe and extracted, yet always balanced. Dazzles with enormous cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, beef jerky, raspberry tart, anise, pepper and smoky cedar flavors that finish with amazing length. Yet the tannin-acid structure is superb, and the wine is totally dry. Beautiful now, and should age through 2012.",Klopp Ranch,96,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"The vineyard was made famous by Williams Selyem for fantastically rich, ageable Pinot Noirs. Now Merry Edwards has her own bottling, and it's right up there. Tastes young and grape-sappy, with jammy black cherry, cola, licorice and dusty Asian spice flavors, perfectly accented with smoky new oak. Needs time, and will develop complexities through 2012, at least.",Flax Vineyard,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"The winery's most expensive wine comes from very low-yielding Martini selection grapes planted in 1975. The '07, tasted at a bit more than one year of age, was pronounced in smoky oak and robust tannins, showing jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise, cloves and cedar. Hold this powerful wine until 2011.",Arrendell Vineyard,95,85,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"Super-rich, a fat, opulent Chard that tastes almost as sweet as a dessert, except it's dry. Shows massive flavors of Meyer lemon custard, minerals, pear tart, buttered toast, butterscotch, smoky pie crust and honey, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Lush and gorgeous.",Allen Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.",Heintz Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A beautiful, polished Pinot Noir that offers loads of flavor, while preserving the vital acidity that keeps the wine fresh and balanced.

Drink now through 2013.",Dutton Ranch,94,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Always a dense wine in youth, Keefer is an ager, and winemaker Ehren Jordan has captured its essence with this impressive young wine. Shows classic Russian River structure, with firm acids and a dusting of tannins that frame vibrant flavors of cherry, rhubarb, red currant, cola, pomegranate and cedar. Delicious and compelling, this wine will evolve for up to six years.",Keefer Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"This is a big, ripe Zin from a great vineyard in a warm part of the appellation. There's a lot of heat, but it works well with the blackberry pie, cherry tart and milk chocolate flavors. Nice and dry, if a bit soft.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ledson
US,"Even tasted from magnum, this wine is starting to show its age, revealing smooth tannins and a slightly thinning texture. Meaty notes add spice to the beet and earth aromas and flavors. Drink up.",Quail Hill Vineyard,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"This isn't one of those rich, gooey Chardonnays that dazzle some people. But it's a crisp, minerally wine that shows great elegance and Chablis-like sophistication. Dry and crisp, it shows complex flavors of tart green apples and pears, with subtle influences of smoky oak.",Estate Bottled,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"This is Merry Edwards' personal vineyard, and as the vines gain age, the wines get better and better. The 2006 is young and grapey and needs time in the cellar to come around. It's a powerhouse of a wine, stuffed with black and red cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors. Impresses for the sheer depth of flavor and overall balance. Best after 2010, if you can keep your hands off it.",Meredith Estate,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A blend of several vineyards located near the winery, in the valley's famed Middle Reach, this is the biggest and richest of Williams Selyem's Spring 2007 releases.

Yet the balance is just fine, with crisp coastal acidity and richly textured tannins. Drink early for its youthful pleasures.",Bohemian Vineyard,93,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
US,"This is a seriously good Pinot. It's easy to imagine drinking it at a great restaurant, with a fabulous steak. The tannin-acid structure is just perfect, and the texture is silky. Yet tasted at the age 18 months, it's a bit heavy in jammy cherries and raspberries, which suggests aging. Try holding off until 2011–2015.",Toboni Vineyard,93,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. The texture is right down the middle between silky-light and full-bodied. Beautiful now and through 2012.",Salzgeber Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"Like your Zins high in alcohol and Porty? Try this one, which comes from low-yielding, century-old vines. It will have its fans, but for this taster, it's hot, dry and raisiny.",Fanucchi-Wood Vineyard,84,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hartford
US,"Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.",Bacigalupi Vineyards,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",Sonoma Reserve,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"This is a wine made for the cellar. It's dark, and smells rich, with ripe blackberry and plum fruit and a hefty dose of vanilla-scented, smoky oak. Full-bodied, but the tannins are hefty now, and the acidity is high. Probably best to put it away for four or five years and see what happens.",Laureles,89,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Davis Bynum
US,"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Affaire de Coeur
US,"Here's a big, rich, full-bodied Zin that calls for equally big foods, like tri-tip, barbecued ribs and Szechuan-style beef. Although it's extremely dry, it's fruity, with flavors of blackberries, mulberries and plums, accented with spices, sassafras and grilled meat.",Feeney Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This Pinot Noir balances its extraordinary richness with a silky texture, crisp acidity and a dry, tangy minerality. The immediate impression is of fruit: cherries, raspberries and milk chocolate. Yet the finish is brisk and clean. Irresistably drinkable.",Third Alarm Reserve,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"Similar to the excellent 2005, this bottling needs some time in the cellar to let the fruit, tannins, acids and oak knit together. Tasted in early winter of 2009, it's fresh and dramatic, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, licorice, orange zest and cedar. Try toward 2010.",Tobias Glen,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Too hot and overripe, with a heavy, baked fruit quality. Although the wine is fully dry, it has a stewed blackberry taste. The alcohol is 15.5%.",,83,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hartford
US,"A beautifully complex and sophisticated wine, showing lush flavors of red cherry pie filling, cranberry tart, Dr. Pepper and cedar. Finishes rich and butterscotchy, but thoroughly dry, with a crisp tang of citrusy acidity. Now through 2012.",,92,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A luscious Pinot Noir, dark and rich in blackberry, cherry, cola, cocoa, cedar and spice flavors. It's big and powerful now in fruit, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",Mononi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"The vineyard is in the warmest corner of the valley, almost into Dry Creek, and the wine in its youth is a bit heavy. But it's quite rich and complex, showing flavors of currants, mocha, espresso, oranges, cola and peppery spice. Nice now, with a good steak, and could easily develop over the next 8 years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Bright berries are all dressed up in cedary, pencil-like oak and kissed with velvety black-tea and creamy chocolate notes that linger through the finish. Closes a bit lean, probably a function of the less-than-stellar vintage, but a solid effort.",Lone Oak Vineyard,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Rosenblum
US,"Made in a softly flamboyant style, with massive flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème brûlée, firmed with stony minerals. Tons of stuffing in this opulent Chardonnay, which was aged in 50% new oak.",Highlands Estates Piner Hills,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is quite a good Pinot Noir, and one to drink now for its silky deliciousness. It flatters the palate with ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper. Hard to imagine anyone not liking it a lot.",Coster Vineyard,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vision Cellars
US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.",Tré Terre,91,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Only 20% new oak on this wine, but it sure does stand out, dominating the modest fruit with a smoky, charry taste. Hard to like this toothpicky Chard.",Lot 20,82,11,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
US,"This is a cool-climate wine made in a good vintage. It's very dry and rich in acidity and tannins, but well-ripened grapes have yielded deep flavors of blackberry jam, blueberries and pepper, with a savory edge of grilled meat. This balanced, powerful Syrah will evolve over the next six years.",Cherry Ridge Vineyard,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Quite pale for a Pinot Noir, and with a lilting, delicately silky mouthfeel. But there's nothing light about the flavors, which are intricate as a tapestry. The cherries, raspberries, orange peel and vanilla have an herbal edge of rosehip tea and rhubarb pie. Now through 2012.",,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"Dobles lías means double lees. Extended lees contact has given this Chard great creaminess in the mouth, a smooth impression that is heightened by malolatic fermentation. Beyond that, the wine is fully dry, balanced in alcohol, and lush in flavor. Pineapple custard and charred meringue take center stage, but there's a complex cast of Key lime pie, peach preserves, butterscotch, cinnamon and vanilla. Compelling and authoritative.",Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard,94,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries.",Odyssey,83,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Enkidu
US,"Some off-notes mar this Pinot Noir. It smells a little vegetal, and then turns soft and fruity in the mouth, with flavors of cherries and cocoa.",Bluffs,83,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, showing flamboyantly ripe cherry, raspberry and chocolate-cola fruit, spiced with cinnamon and anise and enhanced with smoky oak. Fortunately, all this richness is framed in a fine structure of acidity and tannins. Drink now through 2012.",Estate Grown,91,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
US,"Soft and gentle, yet firm in tannins, this Zin has an interesting dried herb and molasses edge to the blackberries, cherries and peppery spices. It's full-bodied, dry and complex, a wine to pair with beef dishes.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Very ripe and fruity-spicy, almost like a Zinfandel except for the silkiness, this Pinot shows flavors of black cherry pie filling, red currants and pomegranates, with earthier notes of cola and sweet tobacco. It's a bone dry wine whose thick tannins suggest modest ageability. Now through 2012.",Dutton Ranch,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Crisp and silky, this is a pretty Pinot Noir to drink now. It offers a wealth of cherry, cola, anise, sandalwood, cinnamon and pepper flavors that finish dry and complex.",,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak.",,83,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Derbes
US,"Feels a bit heavy now, with direct flavors, like cherry and chocolate cream pie filling without the crust. However, there are suggestions that aging will benefit. The tannins are thick, and the acidity is good enough to carry the wine through some evolution. Try after 2011.",Longbow,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This is a big, oaky, creamy Chardonnay, but it retains the crisp acidity and overall control to be balanced and even elegant despite its size. Shows potent flavors of pineapple-infused crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla custard. Drink now.",Winemaker's Reserve,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Souverain
US,"Bright and zesty, with flavors of limes, kiwi fruit, green apples and pineapples, accompanied by crisp acidity. Could almost be an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Oak plays only a supporting role.",,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jordan
US,"Really classic Russian River Chard, so elegantly structured and sleek, yet so flavorful. A wonderful structure of bright acidity and fine, toasty oak frames succulent flavors of pineapples, tangerines, green apples pears and minerals, leading to a long, richly spicy finish.",,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"From a venerable Burgundian producer comes this earthy, spicy wine, with a body and texture that are unctuous and creamy. There's a whole fruit basket here, with everything from green apples to peaches to tropical fruit. What's harder to express is the wine's power to satisfy. Rich and lush, it swings for the bleachers and just misses, but it's a solid triple. Editors' Choice.",Mariage,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"Angeline is one of the best second labels in California, in this case from Martin Ray. This '08 Sauvignon smacks of ripe, tangy Asian pear, gooseberry, fig, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors brightened by wonderfully crisp acidity. Just beautiful, and a nice bargain at this price.",,90,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Angeline
US,"Acidity marks this Chardonnay. It gives a tart, mouth-cleansing citrusy scour to the lemon and lime and pineapple flavors that finish so dry. It's a minimalist wine, with a minerally frame, and quite good with shellfish.",Estate Bottled,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"Lots of plush, ripe sour cherry, currant, cola and pomegranate flavors in this dry, silky wine, but also lots of tannins. Like chewing on a grape skin, with the resulting astringency. Needs time. Better after 2010.",Hallberg Vineyard,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.",,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Of The Place
US,"This is one of the best rosés in California. It's totally dry, crisply acidic and delicately structured, with subtle, complex flavors that run from cherries, cranberries and rose petals to dried herbs and peppery Asian spice. Hats off to consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs for mastering the essence of rosé.",Vin Gris Rosé of,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"This is the least expensive of Barnett's new single-vineyard Pinots, but it's also the richest and tastiest. It's a luscious wine, filling the mouth with cherry, currant, cola, sassafras or root beer, vanilla and anise flavors, wrapped into a silky texture. Feels luxurious and fine. Drink now through 2013.",Tina Marie Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett
US,"A really nice Sauvignon Blanc. Fundamentally dry, but rich in fruity extract, it shows crisp, creamy flavors of pineapples, limes, sweet Meyer lemons, vanilla and smoky oak, girded by a firm minerality. Shows how well the cool Russian River Valley can treat this variety.",,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Ledson
US,"Really balanced and elegant, with such bracing acidity. Shows pure flavors of cherries and cassis, with earthy, forest floor notes and a touch of cherry tomato and beetroot. Only moderately oaked, just enough to add a smoky edge. Very young and minerally now, this should hold and improve for five to eight years.",,91,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Emeritus
US,"Right out there on the border of superripe, in fact almost sweet, but carefully avoids a sugary finish. Still, it's abundantly rich in blackberry and fruity-tea flavors that are dry in the most technical sense.",Reserve,84,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frei Brothers
US,"Acorn persists with this Italian variety despite the challenges. It's dry and medium-bodied, with a silky texture and some hot acids. The flavors are of cherries and tobacco. Overall, it's a clean country wine.",Alegria Vineyards,84,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Dolcetto,Acorn
US,"This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex.",O.F.S.,95,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"This is a polished, pretty wine of great power. It displays a dazzling array of red and black cherry, raspberry, currant and licorice flavors, tinged with mocha and cedar. Has a certain young vine freshness. Mid-term cellaring for a couple years will help it knit together.",Coopersmith,89,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, lightly delicate and elegantly silky, yet with powerhouse flavors that impress. Floods the palate with wild red cherry, cola, sandalwood and cinnamon spice flavors, excited with clean acidity. Drink now.",Reserve,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"A very lush, fruity wine, if a bit soft, with flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. Satisfies for its richness and creamy texture.",Four Hearts Vineyards,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"Rich and appealing, a new bottling from the winery. All the parts have yet to knit together, but they're all good, and the wine should drink well by winter 2007. New oak frames tart green apple, pineapple, kumquat and cinnamon spice flavors that are heightened by bright, zesty acidity.",Emelia's Cuvée,90,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"A Syrah of considerable proportions, made in the Novy style of power and ripeness. It's suprising that Novy didn't priced it higher, as it has that extractive richness and inherent wealth of texture that are the domain of expensive red wines. Just tremendous in blackberries, chocolate and spices, with the most beautiful tannins. Drink now, with the finest meats.",Parsons' Vineyard,94,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Good Chardonnay, rich and ripe and steely. That metallic thing shows up both in the crisp acidity and in the stony, pebbly tang that adds a piquant freshness to the pineapple, lime tart, tangerine and smoky custard-cream flavors.",Estate Grown,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"Very ripe and lush, this Pinot shows deep flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla fudge, mint, cinnamon, nutmeg and sandalwood. It's at its silky, exotic best now and for a few more years.",Nugent Vineyard,89,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler

US,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",Don Miguel Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"If the grapes were any riper, they'd be doing chin-ups in the glass. A blast of pungent peach, green apple and cantaloupe notes is accented by new oak. That power carries over to the flavors. It might almost be too ripe for food. Definitely in the California style, like it or not.",,87,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Philip Staley
US,"Very pale in color, just beyond rose. Wonderfully fragrant aromas of black cherries, cola, Oriental spices, smoke and mushroomy earth. It packs a real punch in the mouth, too, with a great depth of rich, fruity, spicy flavor. Dry, with soft tannins but lively acidity.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rutz
US,"The vineyard is virtually in Dry Creek Valley, so it's not surprising to find the briary, brambly intensity of that warm Sonoma appellation. It's a good, lush, likeable Zin, brimming with wild berry, leather, tobacco and pepper spice flavors swimming in firm, dry tannins.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,89,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,John Tyler
US,"Almost nobody in California makes a Columbard, especially in a high-rent district like Russian River, but this white wine deserves your attention. It's dry and very crisp in acidity, with flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, pears, honeysuckle flowers and spices. Great as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio.",Old Vines,89,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Colombard,Y Rousseau
US,"This is a very concentrated and intense young Sauvignon Blanc. With 43% new oak, it shows a rich creaminess riding over the laser-like gooseberry, grapefruit and lime flavors. It's also extremely crisp in acidity, since malolactic fermentation was entirely prevented.",La  Petite Etoile Vineyard,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean
US,"A rich, complex Chardonnay with apple and peach notes and a strong mineral component. A scent of something like gunmetal or flint follows through in the flavors and helps give the wine a steely backbone. A distinctive wine; very dry and crisp.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rutz
US,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste. Floods the mouth with pineapple tart, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla flavors, with suggestions of kiwis, limes and green apples. Delicious and appealing.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Testarossa held back the release date for a while, but this is still a pretty tannic wine. Feels heavy and furry, although the complex black cherry, plum and bacon flavors break through to impress. A bit awkward tasted in the Spring of 2009, but could evolve after mid-2010.",Fritschen Vineyard,88,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,88,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Very vibrant in acidity and bright green fruit character, suggesting limes, lychee and lemongrass. A drop of Viognier and a tiny percent of oak add softening, enriching notes. Very fine and dry. Good with ceviche, grilled veggies on bruschetta topped with melted goat cheese.",Block Collection River Ranches,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
US,"Here's a gusty, bold Zin whose powerhouse flavors call for equally strong fare, such as braised short ribs and barbecue. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with explosive flavors of blackberries, plums, anise, balsamic-splashed sautéed mushrooms, espresso, tabasco and pepper. Finishes a bit Porty in raisins. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Great Zin. It's robust and brawny, in the way of Zin, with the rustic wild berry, nettle, chamomile and spice flavors you expect from the variety, but shows good control in the smooth tannins and modulated alcohol. Picks up extra points for sheer deliciousness.",Eight Cousins Vineyard,89,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pellegrini
US,"This wine preserves the region's vital characteristics (well-ripened fruit and spice), although they've been diluted by necessity for commercial purposes, what with 28,000 cases produced. Light and soft, with delicate yet surprisingly delicious black-raspberry, smoke and cinnamon notes.",,86,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"More tannicly dense than Failla's estate Sonoma Coast bottling, this Pinot wants a few years in the cellar. You can drink it now because it's so delicious in cherry and raspberry fruit, but there's a tightness, an astringency that suggests 3-4 years to come around. If you pop the cork now, give it a few hours of decanting.",Keefer Ranch,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.",Zio Tony Ranch,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"There's not much, if any, oak on this Chardonnay, leaving the fresh, clean fruit flavors to star. Shows a rich array of pineapples, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots and peaches, with spicy, vanilla overtones. Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rued
US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level. Barrel fermented in 80% new oak, aged on the lees and put through full malolactic fermentation, it's rich, creamy, buttery and exotically flavored in opulent toasted barrel and tropical fruits. I personally like this style, but others might find it too oaky.",Winemaker's Reserve,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Château Souverain
US,"Another successful Pinot, similar to the '04— may be a bit crisper and more elegant, but with the same lovely cola, cherry, strawberry, root beer, dusty spice and vanilla-oak flavors. Probably offering its most exuberant side now and for a year or two.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pellegrini
US,"No winery has associated itself more with Petite Sirah than Foppiano. That understanding shows in this wine, which wrestles the variety's rustically wild nature into something resembling submission. Still, it retains its dry, tannic edge, with all sorts of forest berry and herb flavors. Will live for many years, gradually softening.",Estate,88,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Foppiano
US,"This is a very pure, fresh and clean Chardonnay. While it's rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and smoky oak flavors, it's also well balanced. Shows brisk, citrusy acidity and a firm stream of minerals.",O.F.S.,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"As weighty as a Chardonnay, this is a Sauvignon Blanc whose nuances will be killed if you over-chill it. You could even decant it for a while and let it approach room temperature. Dry and rich, it shows savory, complex tiers of pineapples, limes, green apples, sweet golden tobacco, vanilla, white pepper and even a touch of thyme.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"Dry and richly oaked, with ripe flavors, this is a big Chardonnay. It shows massive flavors of pineapple custard, pear jam, butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. A bit direct, but a crowd pleaser.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"A dry, and elegant fruit-forward wine. It was harvested relatively early, at lower brix, resulting in crisp acidity and succulent flavors of tart green apples and kiwis, with a tang of pepper and cinnamon. Delicious.",Unoaked,88,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"A beautiful wine, just what Pinot Gris should be. Drily crisp, with a mouth-cleansing raciness, it offers complex flavors of citrus fruits, flowers and minerals, wrapped into a creamy texture.",Windsor Oaks Vineyard,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Terremoto Cellars
US,"Ripely fruity and soft, showing upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, tobacco, cola, mocha and pepper. Tastes a little sweet in charred wood extract.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy

US,"A fine evocation of a Russian River Pinot from a good vintage. It's dry and silky and crisp, with rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, cedar, cinnamon and pepper. Delicious. Drink now.",,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",Fiorella,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",Tré Terre,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Wow. This is one big, impressive Sauvignon Blanc. It's the grass and gooseberry, and the acidity. The wine hits the palate like a bomb, dry and crisp and explosive. Mid-palate, the fruit emerges, peaches, figs, melons, limes, kiwi. This is De Loach's first OFS Sauvignon and it's worthy of the designation.",OFS,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,De Loach
US,"This is a very dry, silky Pinot Noir made in a more restrained manner than some of the big, huge ones out there. It doesn't whack your head, but appeals for its elegance. Shows sophisticated cherry, sassafras and sandalwood flavors, and the price is extremely good for the quality.",,90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pedroncelli
US,"Tastes of new oak and is also acidic, a combo that makes the mouthfeel rather harsh and salty, despite obviously well-ripened fruit. May settle down and show softer, lusher notes in a year or so.",Dominique,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Shows the balance and harmony of RRV Pinot, at a fair price. Dry and silky, bursting with cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate and cinnamon spice flavors that are enriched with sweet vanilla from oak barrels. Easy to find, with more than 17,000 cases produced.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"This is one of your bigger, fatter, riper Russian River Pinots, with jammy, oak-accented cherry, raspberry, root beer and vanilla flavors that are very forward and lush. The wine is extremely soft, though, and could certainly use a boost of acidity for balance. Still, it sure is tasty. Drink now.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonnet
US,"Jacaman's been doing a good job with their Russian River Pinot. This one's a bit off the pace of the '03, due to the hotter vintage that makes the wine riper and simpler. But it's still a flavorful, dry, silky wine, with a fair degree of complexity. Drink now.",,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
US,"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results. The wine is dry, silky and interesting, showing an array of cherry, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors. Has enough of a complex tannin structure to pair with lamb chops, or a great grilled salmon steak.",,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
US,"Almost sweet in pineapple custard, marzipan and butterscotch flavors, and there may even be a bit of residual sugar in this honey-rich Chard. Saved by a crisp backbone of acidity.",OFS,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Good everyday Chard, with direct flavors of pineapples and kiwis, and the buttercream and smoky vanillins that oak barrels contribute. Finishes dry and crisp.",,86,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Could be a bit firmer and more structured in acidity. Shows a soft, easy, silky texture, with forward flavors of melted blackberry jam, sour red cherry, cola, and cinnamon spice, with some bitterness in the finish. Drink now.",The Whitewing Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
US,"A good, rich, village-style Pinot Noir with some real class, especially in the structure. The flavors of cola, cherries, red currants, licorice and cocoa are just fine, but it's the crispness and silky tannins that lift it up.",Heintz Ranch,89,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutch Bill Creek
US,"A bit on the hot, unbalanced side. Despite dryness, ripe cherry pie, cola, cinnamon and sweet vanilla flavors and a gentle, silky texture, there's some burn, and not a lot of depth. Drink now.",Maboroshi Vineyard,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Easily the best Hanna Pinot Noir in memory, this pretty wine is light and crisp and delicious, with cherry, cola, cocoa, anise and spice flavors. Nice now with lamb chops, roast salmon.",,87,31,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanna

US,"Light-bodied, soft and pastry-rich, with easy flavors of cherry, raspberry and vanilla granola. Nice now, with its silky texture and instant appeal.",Chenoweth Ranch,87,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"For the price, this dessert wine is quite a good buy in an upscale sweetie. It shows honeyed flavors of apricots, pineapples, oranges, vanilla fudge and cinnamon spice.",Oley Sweet,87,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
US,"Few wineries in California any longer produce this Chardonnay-like French variety, but Dutton-Goldfield continues to do a good job. It has a creamy texture, with flavors of peaches, green apples, pears, vanilla and cinnamon spice. With no oak, it's a clean, crisply acidic wine.",Dutton Ranch Shop Block,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This Napa winery has been reaching into the Russian River for their Chardonnay, with good results. Dry and crisp in acids, the wine has a minerality behind the green apple, peach and melon flavors. The firm structure should provide for aging through 2009.",,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Girard
US,"A lovely Zinfandel, dry and elegant and balanced. Yet it preserves Zin's briary, brambly character, with wild berry, currant, cola and pepper flavors. Really savory and a delight to drink.",Cool Climate Vineyards,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"A brisk, clean Chardonnay with a firm footing of minerals undergirding polished pineapple, pear and cedar flavors. Offers lots of sophisticated pleasure at a good price.",Barrel Reserve,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Toasted Head
US,"A bit overripe in raisins, with a chocolate-currant core enriched with smoky new oak. But the texture is silky and fine, and the finish is dry and spicy. Drink now.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longboard
US,"Shows good character in the dryness, crispness, smooth tannins and silky texture that frame ripe cherry pulp, cola, vanilla and pepper flavors. On the minus side is a sharply acidic finish. Drink soon.",Heintz Ranch,87,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutch Bill Creek
US,"Here's a crisp, dry, young Sauvignon Blanc, with a little cat pee, but fortunately it's drowned in a flood of grapefruit, lime, passionfruit and fig flavors. Crisp acidity scours the palate and gets those tastebuds whistling.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
US,"A good, flavorful Pinot Noir that shows exceptionally ripe cherry and sassafras fruit, balanced with fine tannins. It's a little on the soft side. Drink now, with lamb and roasted potatoes.",Open-top Vat Fermentation,88,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Although there's lots to like in this Zin, it's just too sweet. On the plus side are rich, complex flavors of cherry pie, raspberry tart, cassis, cocoa and mushu plum sauce, accented by peppery spices and a bit of wood. Also nice are the dense but ripe tannins. But then there's that sugary, brownie taste that's inappropriate in a table wine.",,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is a balanced, easy to drink Chardonnay, with citrus, peach and green apple flavors that have been finished with a veneer of smoky oak. It's totally dry. Do not overchill it, as it's a delicate wine that needs some warmth to open up.",OFS,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Acorn, which does such interesting things with Rhône varieties, shows it's no slouch with Bordeaux varieties, to judge from this fresh, succulent young red wine. It's medium-bodied and dry, with polished flavors of cherries, blueberries, leather and herbs and a long, spicy finish.",Alegria Vineyards,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Acorn
US,"Tastes young and strong in primary fruit flavors—cherries, raspberries and spicy cola, accented with the caramel and vanilla of toasted oak. Impeccably balanced in tannins and acids, this wine should develop bottle interest over the next 3–5 years.",Chenowith Ranch,88,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Quite a bit sweeter on the palate than J's Pinot Gris in the past, with a sugary edge to the otherwise pretty pineapple, vanilla and wildflower flavors. Acidity helps to balance, but this is not, strictly speaking, dry.",,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"A nice Syrah that appeals for its lush flavors. It's too soft, with a melted quality, but the blackberry, chocolate, leather, anise and pepper flavors are so tasty, you hardly notice.",,86,12,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Duende
US,"A nice, easy drinking Sauvignon Blanc that shows the citrusy acids that make this variety so popular. Shows pineapple, honeysuckle, orange blossom, lemon zest and vanilla spice flavors that finish a little sweet, but clean and zesty.",,86,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards. It's almost what the French call demi-sec, with sugared lemon mousse and raspberry-vanilla cream flavors.",Vintage Brut,84,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"This is a good, everyday Merlot with some additional qualities of elegance. It's soft and mellow, with nice flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, chocolate and licorice.",,86,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Angeline
US,"Call it Chablis-like. This Chard is bone dry, crisp in citrusy acidity, and features stony, minerally flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. Try as a richer alternative to Pinot Grigio.",Lot 115,86,13,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
US,"Merlot is tricky under the best circumstances, and this one is adequate, at best. Dry and fairly tannic, it shows modest, somewhat overripe blackberry flavors.",Estate,83,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Foppiano
US,"Shows a distinctly rustic note in the jagged tannins, green acids and somewhat thin blackberry fruit that's stretched with dill and mint. Sweet oak helps to fatten it up.",Estate,83,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Foppiano
US,"With apricot, pineapple, rice wine vinegar and white sugar flavors, this wine tastes like a sweet-and-sour sauce in a Chinese restaurant. The acidity is emphasized on the prickly finish.",Angeline,83,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Martin Ray
US,"A good, rich Chardonnay, marked by pleasantly crisp acidity and a buttercreamy texture housing fruity flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples and kiwi. Shows good Russian River character. Don't drink it too cold.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,White Oak
US,"Tastes grapey, with green table grape, pineapple, vanilla and spice flavors, and the finish is totally dry and crisp. It's a good, rich, savory wine, rather like a Pinot Gris, at a good price.",Old Vines,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Colombard,Y Rousseau
US,"From Domaine St. George, a polished, ripe wine, from a premier growing region. It's dry and a little rough in texture, with complex flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, and a cleansing espresso bitterness to the finish.",,86,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,STG
US,"Dry, soft and earthy, this Pinot Noir shows flavors of cherries, cola, tobacco, black pepper and herbs, wrapped into a silky texture. It could develop additional bottle complexities over the next few years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"Raw and hot, with a burnt cherry pie taste and a dry, tannic finish.",Estate,82,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Foppiano
US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",Mills Vineyard,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.",Hopkins Vineyard,86,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking.",Alegria,91,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"Very ripe in the mouth, with mounds of black cherry and mocha flavors, this Pinot has a full-bodied, slightly heavy feeling. It's dry and silky, and a nice example of a good Russian River Pinot from a warm vintage.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Dry and distinctly wild in brambly, briary berry fruit and spice. At first this Zin feels rustic, with a sandpapery grip and fresh, juicy acids. But the brilliant structure of acidity, bracing tannins and caressing mouthfeel reveal how delicate this really is. This is great Zinfandel.",Lone Redwood Ranch,94,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"All the components of fine Zinfandel are in top form here, from the opening fat, dark berry aromas to the deep, sweet fruit on the smoothly textured palate and the lovely fruit-acid balance. Closes handsomely, with full even tannins and some white pepper on the long back end. Drinks well now and has the structure to last and improve for a few years as well.",Collins Vineyard,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Limerick Lane
US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.",Dutton Ranch Dutton Palms Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"Nearly five years after it was made, this Syrah remains dark and tannic, but the fruit is starting to make the magical transition from primary to secondary. It's picking up dried blackberry, dessicated blueberry and beef jerky flavors that finish long and spicy. Yet it still has youthful acidity and freshness. This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is a new wine from Longboard. The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the Middle Reach area that is prime Pinot country. But somehow, Merlot loves it. Softly lush and complex, with blackberry, blueberry, cherry, cola and spiced coffee flavors, finishing with new oaky vanillins. Really notable for its balance and harmony.",DaKine Vineyard,92,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard
US,"Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy. Acidity is high, and gives a tangy minerality that adds complexity.",Dutton Ranch Kyndall's Reserve,92,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"Siduri's basic Russian River bottling is very ripe in fruit, heavy in texture and soft, with a cherry, coffee and chocolate syrup flavor. It's as tasty as a candy. Drink now.",,84,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Fruity and oaky, with rich flavors of pineapples, pears, buttercream, vanilla cookie and toasty meringue. Crisp acidity provides clean balance.",,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"If this wine were drier and crisper it would be a lot finer. The flavors are very rich, suggesting ripe pineapple tart, Meyer lemon pie, vanilla and sweet butter. It's almost sugary, except it's probably technically dry.",Dutton Ranch - Kylie's Cuvee,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"Dry, crisp and herbal, with tobacco, cola, red licorice and tannic cherryskin flavors. A silky, polished Pinot for early drinking.",,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"A bit harsh and green in tannins, with menthol-infused blackberry and cherry flavors that finish in a scour of pepper. Drink now.",Reserve Richard McDowell Vineyard,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Toad Hollow
US,"Enormously ripe berries characterize this wine; it explodes with wild raspberries, cherries, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a peppery, minty finish. But it's young and vigorous in rich, dense tannins, suggesting ageability. Best now, with decanting, and for several years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Too acidic and sweet for my tastes, with well-ripened cherry and mocha flavors that are certainly flattering. The sweetness seems to get stronger as the wine warms up, making it an awkward sip.",Winemaker's Block Selection,83,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"Made in a New Zealand style, with strong gooseberry, lemongrass and lime flavors, this wine is bone dry and exceptionally crisp in acidity. It gets the tastebuds watering.",,85,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
US,"Firm, tannic and fruity, with some nice tropical fruit flavors, wrapped around stiff tannins and some green, slightly stemmy flavors. The finish is hard and rough.",,85,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Castle
US,"The nose of this Russian River Valley, single-vineyard offering shows positive dark berry fruit bearing mild meaty accents.  Made in a lighter style, the flavors follow the aromatic opening and the wine finishes dry with medium tannins, red berry and tea notes.",Ricci Vyd,85,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mayo
US,"The alcohol is nearly 16%. Yikes! And it shows, with a hot mouthfeel and a glyceriney sweetness. Too bad, because the underlying wine, with cherry, cola, cedar and spice flavors, seems fine.",,84,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
US,"Awkward, with sweet, pie-filling cherry and black raspberry flavors that have an edge of raisins, and a sharp finish. Drink now.",Saralee's Vineyard & Genetti Vineyard,84,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,New Departure
US,"A bit sharp in acids, with some green, minty flavors alongside riper cherries. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",Saralee's Vineyard & Genetti Vineyard,84,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,New Departure
US,"Big, raw and frankly not really showing its best now, this young Zin needs time in the bottle. It has everything that it takes for two or three years aging, at least. Aromas and flavors of crushed pepper, fennel seed and cardamom spice up the blackberry, roasted coffee and bitter chocolate flavors, while the tannins are hefty, but negotiable.",Feeney Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"There's a smoky aroma that's almost cigarette ashy, and a distractingly sweet sugary finish to the cherry and cola flavors of this Pinot Noir. Could be going through a dumb phase. Try after 2009.",Graham Family Vineyard,84,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,August West
US,"Tries for Burgundian richness, but ends up rather common, although it will satisfy fans of buttery, oaky Chardonnays. Shows ripe flavors of pineapple jam, apricot purée and buttered popcorn.",,85,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutch Bill Creek
US,"A very distinctive Chard—full of character and even eccentricity. There are strong, up-front aromas of tangerines, vanilla, butterscotch, smoke, ripe peaches and caramel. It's especially notable for the thick, creamy texture and a penetrating, spicy clove note that follows through on the long, rich finish. A complex, serious wine.",Shop Block Vineyard Dutton Ranch,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure.",Ruxton Vineyard,89,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"Will satisfy Chardophiles with its oaky, creamy flavors and notes of pineapples, lemons and limes. Finishes dry and crisp in acidity.",Lot 101,83,10,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
US,"An interesting wine that makes you think. Straddles the border between minty wintergreen unripeness and cherry-cola ripeness, coming down in favor of the latter. Streamlined and elegant, it's good now for the dry crispness, but not an ager. Drink soon.",Dutton Thomas Road Vineyard,89,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Crisp and fruity, with lemon, lime, pineapple and spice flavors, brightened with mouth-cleansing acidity. Yet it's a bit too strong in those feline pyrazines that lend a green, unripe taste.",Ritchie Vineyard,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,De Loach
US,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",Dutton Vineyard,87,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"We're almost into Port here, not only in the alcohol level, but the flavors. The blackberries, strawberries, raspberries and cherries are almost raisiny, with that taste of plumped dried fruit, leading to a finish of raspberry liqueur. Yet the wine is dry, as well as tannic. There are certainly few Zinfandels like this anywhere, and you'll either like it or you won't.",Mancini Ranch,89,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is the least successful of De Loach's otherwise brilliant new range of Zinfandels, for one simple reason: it's overripe. The alcohol is an astounding 16.5%, and the wine has flavors of raisins and prunes.",Butler Vineyard,84,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"If you like a purely California approach to Zin, you'll exult in this one. High in alcohol, almost Porty, but totally dry, with stewed raspberry, cherry, cola, mocha and spice flavors, it's tough in tannins, and acidic for so ripe a wine. Will do all kinds of interesting things over the next 10 years, without fundamentally changing.",Zeigler Vineyard,89,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Minty and green, a hard, acidic wine only somewhat relieved by cherry and oak flavors. Not bad, but pretty lean.",,83,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Angeline
US,"Awkward and rustic. Although it's entirely dry, it has a sweet, pastry-filling cherry taste, with an edge of raisins. And the texture is sharp and green.",,82,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Romililly
US,"Too oaky, with dominating caramel and smoke flavors, and also very sharp. There's a citrusy bite of acidity that detracts. Finally, the wine ends on an overripe, Porty note.",Windacre,80,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Merriam
US,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014.",Meredith Estate,97,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dense and intricately constructed, this Pinot Noir always is a big, rich fruity wine. The 2007 is perhaps emblematic of the vineyard, showing massive flavors of cherries, blueberries and wilder, foxier berries that have an exotic note. The tannins are thick, and the wine is entirely dry. Very fine, a chef's dream to pair with perfectly matched food. Fine now, with a few hours of decanting, and should develop through 2013, at least.",Klopp Ranch,94,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is a restaurant wine. It's really fancy, really good and really food-friendly. Although it's rich in fruit and oak, it possesses an underlying tension, with acidity and tannins all vying for center stage. You're always looking for the center of gravity. In other words, a wine of great complexity and interest. Now–2013.",Estate Grown,94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
US,"Lots of ripe tropical fruit in this wine, with pastry-filling pineapple, peach, butterscotch and vanilla spice flavors. Although technically dry, it has a richly honeyed finish.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"A solid effort. Dry, delicately silky and elegant, this polished wine shows flavors of red cherries, raspberries, cola and rosehip tea, with an Asian spice finish. Pair with steak.",Reserve,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Pretty good Sauv Blanc, a little one-dimensional, but satisfies for its flowery, citrus blossom and passionfruit flavors that finish in a swirl of palate-stimulating spices.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"Drinkable now, but has the structure for the cellar. Grown in a Forestville vineyard from modern Dijon clones, it's very fruity, offering clean, pure flavors of cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. The cool climate contributes fresh, zesty acidity, but the tannins are considerable. Beautiful now with decanting, and should develop through 2013.",Tobias Glen,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"New oak dominates this young wine, with vanilla-accented buttered toast and smoky aromas. Underneath the wood are strong, complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, licorice, cola and Asian spices. With fine tannins and acidity, it seems to be a natural for the cellar. Hold until after 2011.",Flax Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Off a bit from the '05, but still a good wine, this Sauvignon Blanc shows fresh minty lemongrass, melon, green grass and fennel flavors, backed up with firm acids and, as always, very dry.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",Coopersmith,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dramatic in depth and structure, a cool-climate Syrah that will benefit from some time in the cellar. Deeply saturated in color, bone dry and full bodied, it offers ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, with plenty of black pepper and sweet, chewy leather. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A fruity Pinot Noir, with delicious flavors of raspberry tart, Cocoa Puffs and vanilla cream. Feels a little too soft and melted for the cellar, but it's a sophisticated, dry wine that will pair nicely with steak.",Tina Marie Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett
US,"Here's a tasty little country wine, rich in berry-cherry fruit and chocolate chip cookies. It's soft in tannins, and dry.",Lot 27,84,12,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Cameron Hughes
US,"Soft and simple, this is almost a dessert wine—it's that sweet in raspberry-tart filling and cherry jam flavors. Has just enough acidity but the sugary finish is off-putting.",Nugent Vineyard,84,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"This is not the Calcaire that was so famous years ago. It feels stretched and pulled and thin, like a Chard one-third its price. Barrel fermentation and sur lies aging are all very nice, but the fruit just isn't there to justify this price.",Calcaire,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"Too much acidity in this dry, fruity Pinot. Pale in color, it shows silky tannins and nice cherry, cola and spicy oak flavors, but that minty sharpness is awkward.",Galante Vineyard,84,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Harrington
US,"A nice example of the '08 Pinots, just coming out, and the price is fair for a wine of this quality. Dry and silky, it shows good varietal flavors of cherries, cola, chocolate, sweet pomegranates and smoky oak, with a long, rich finish. Drink now.",Estate Bottled,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"A little on the thin side, this wine has modest green apple, pink grapefruit and vanilla char flavors. It's bone dry and crisp, with a fast finish.",Director's Cut,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Decent everyday Chard, but disappointingly thin, especially for a reserve. All the parts are here, from the creamy mouthfeel and oak to the pineapple and nectarine flavors, but it's like a photocopy of a photocopy.",Reserve,84,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"Not a success. The wine has a rustic feeling, and is so soft, it makes the cola and cherry flavors taste syrupy. Lacks life and vivacity.",Estate Grown,82,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WillowBrook Cellars
US,"I love the delicate complexity of this Pinot, which is a blend of five vineyards along this famous wine trail. If you want to understand RRV Pinot, and particularly from the stretch they call the Middle Reach, study this wine. Dry, crisp and silky, it shows beautifully ripened cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate and spicy-herbal flavors, perfectly integrated with smoky oak, and the brilliant acid-tannin balance of a great vintage.",Westside Road Neighbors,93,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"I love this for its absolute dryness and crispness and minerally depth. There's something coldly metallic in the taste and mouthfeel, and to the extent there's fruit, it's of grapefruits and lime zest, with a flowery exoticness. Sur lies aging and toasty new oak have added richness and layers of subtle nuance. Strikes you for the sheer excellence of its balance. Enjoy now–2010.",Kent Ritchie Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"From the translucent, see-through ruby color to the intricate cola, cherry and toasted coconut flavors, this delicately powerful in a Burgundian way. Feels silky and light-bodied in the mouth, but there's nothing scanty about the wine's powerful intensity of fruit, spice and oak. Best now and for a couple of years.",Manzana Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Shows a beautiful balance of all its parts. The fruit is forwardly ripe, showing cherries, blackberries and rich dark chocolate. But the tannins are firm and supportive, and there's gorgeous acidity that makes the tastebuds sing. This is a really delicious young Syrah for the most upscale foods, and it's at its best now.",Trenton Station Vineyard,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"What great structure you get in this quintessentially food-friendly wine. Absolutely dry, it shows a crisp mineralityF to the pear, pineapple, toasted meringue and sweet, charry oak flavors, and the finish is amazingly deep and long. This is really an impressive Chardonnay.",,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"I like the elegance, but it seems like it was rushed to market. It will certainly benefit from cellaring, as it's young and rude in acids right now, and not showing well. But there's something here in the vast heart of  cherries and pomegranates and overall balance. Should improve by the end of 2007, and hold for another five years.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,91,53,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Big, juicy Pinot, dry and fruity, with layers of flavor that change with every sip. Black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, coffee, sweet tobacco, spice and oak all mingle in a myriad of sensations, finishing long and intense. Good now, but tannicly closed enough to warrant cellaring beyond 2007.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Midnight black and drily astringent, this is not a wine to pop open tonight. But it's extraordinarily ripe and deep in black currants, with all kinds of earthy cocoa, balsamic, basil, Portobello, coffee and spice flavors. It will blossom and knit together with some time in the bottle. Best 2008–2011, at least.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Pale, light-bodied, fruity and dry, this is the un-Cabernet, the red for white wine lovers. So easy to enjoy, you might overlook its complexities. Red cherries, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cinnamon and ginger candy, it's really delicious. Drink now for its freshness.",,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alderbrook
US,"Showing quite a bit of tannins and acids, this is a very young wine, of a kind that isn't seen all that much in Russian River Valley these days. Swan makes their Pinots the old-fashioned way, for aging. Dry and astringent, the wine has a deep core of cherry and blackberry fruit, almost like a Merlot, except for the silkiness. Stick this in your cellar until 2008, at least.",Great Oak Vineyard,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"My experience of Swan Pinots is that they've been made the same way for a long time, and require aging. This one shows some hard tannins and even some tough acids, although it's tremendous in cherry-pie filling, black raspberry and blackberry jam flavors. Right now it feels juvenile, rude, even rustic, but five to eight years in the cellar will reward.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Straddles the line between villages-type and premier cru Pinot. Light in color and body, one minute it seems simple and fruity, the next, it shows the complex dimensions of a fine young Burgundy. Hard to tell where it's headed, but it's a dry, crisp, silky wine, with lip-smacking cherry, cola and oak flavors.",Saralee's Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"High in acidity and bone dry, this light-colored Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional right now, but I think it was released too early. It should gain momentum by the end of 2007, when the cherry, rhubarb and cola flavors become more integrated with the tannins and oak. If you have to drink it now, decant for several hours.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,89,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Really young now, this vineyard block bottling needs a little time to come into its own. Tasted in February, a combination of acidity and bottle shock has made it brittle. But it's a very good wine, deliciously flavored, with a medium-bodied silkiness and Pinot's exotic sensuality.",Lot 4 Selection,88,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moshin
US,"Notable for its dryness and minerally tang, this is a tight, young Chardonnay right now. The flavors veer toward grapefruits, with notes of passionfruit and honeysuckle. The wine has gone through malolactic, but it's still an acidic wine, almost lean, but elegant. Call it Chablisian.",Lorenzo Vineyard,88,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"Superripe in black cherry, cola and mocha flavors enhanced with smoky oak, this is soft, but quite elegant. It's not an ager, but has a full-bodied richness that suggests steaks and chops.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,88,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton Estate
US,"Alderbrook is one of those insider wineries that does a good job at a fair price. This crisp, dry Chard is an elegant example of the long hangtime '05 vintage, with spicy tropical fruit, butterscotch and vanilla cream flavors.",,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Alderbrook
US,"This is the first Viognier from Lost Canyon I've had, and it's very good. An early release from last year's vintage, it's supercrisp in fresh young acidity, with the long hangtime fruit of a cool harvest. Marked by intense tropical fruit, wildflower, vanilla and spice flavors.",Catie's Corner Vineyard,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Lost Canyon
US,"Very dry, high in acidity and with a minty edge to the cherries and blackberries, this wine tastes young and raspingly tart right now. It's elegant enough in structure, but wants opulence. Hard to tell if it will go anywhere.",Alegria Vineyard,86,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"This is one of the winery's ripest, softest current Pinot releases. It's dry, but a bit heavy in mouthfeel, with a slightly stewed quality to the cherry and berry flavors. It also has some dry, astringent tannins in the finish. Could evolve over the next five years, but the overall quality is not likely to improve.",,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A difficult wine made problematic by the vintage. The cherry fruit tastes overtly sweet, and I suspect there's some residual sugar, the tradeoff for keeping alcohol moderate. Most unfortunate, because everything else works.",Rochioli Vineyard,83,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Castalia
US,"Kind of harsh, with green, searing acidity. The wine is fully dry and silky, with decent cherry and spice flavors, but it has that cutting quality.",Estate,83,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moshin
US,"Comes down on the heavy, full-bodied side for Pinot Noir, with plenty of cherry, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. Sweetened with toasty oak, there's also a spicy sandalwood richness that brings an exotic note. Doesn't seem likely to improve, so drink up.",Karmen Isabella Dutton Ranch,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"There is lots of charm in this soft, gentle Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but it offers some nice cherry, Dr. Pepper and spice flavors.",,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Michael Pozzan
US,"As sweet as a dessert pastry, with vanilla, cream, toast, butter and pineapple jam flavors. Vibrant acidity provides balance just in time.",,85,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Michael Pozzan
US,"This feels lush and important right out of the bottle, tantalizing with tart cherry, cola and persimmon flavors that are wrapped in acids and tannins. Give it up to six years, and enjoy. All of the fruit comes from the Foray Vineyard in the Green Valley.",Foray,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bailiwick
US,"One of the best Russian River Pinots you can buy at this price. Shows classically rich pomegranate, persimmon and cherry fruit, enhanced with sweet oak, with a silky texture and a long, spicy finish. Kudos to winemaker Ed Kurtzman for bringing it all together.",,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,August West
US,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.",Heintz Vineyard,92,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.",Keefer Ranch,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tartness—like a squeeze of lime juice. Past that is an enormously rich, dry, vibrant wine, explosive in raspberries, cherries and ripe, sweet persimmons. New French oak, with its caramel-like toastiness, is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. It's a bit disjointed now, but give it 3–4 years in the cellar, and it should come around.",Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard,91,72,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Made in the popular style, this will find plenty of fans. It's sweet and creamy in buttered toast, pineapple and pear flavors.",,85,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Picket Fence
US,"Ripe cherry, mocha and spice flavors mark this tannic Petite Sirah. It tastes rich in fruit and oak, but finishes clean and dry. Not an ager, but a fine wine to pair now with steak, duck or lamb dishes.",Estate Bottled,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Foppiano
US,"With this bottling, Marimar Estate confirms itself as one of the two best, most consistent producers of Albariño in California, along with Longoria. The wine is brilliant, with brisk acidity, dryness, modest alcohol and complex flavors of citrus fruit and zest, minerals, white tobacco and ripe figs.",Don Miguel Vineyard,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Albariño,Marimar Estate
US,"An exceptionally good Pinot, from a winery that frequently gets overlooked, perhaps because they're not charging an arm and a leg. The wine is light and silky in the mouth, with alcohol well under 14%, and marked with crisp acidity and fine-grained tannins. The flavors are classic pomegranates, rhubarbs and black cherries. Should develop over the next 4–6 years. What a great value.",Estate,92,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"A strong, punchy Pinot Noir, ungainly now for its immaturity, showing tons of jammy raspberries and cherries. The acidity is tart, which is good in a wine this rich, providing balance, and there's also a scour of tannins. All indications suggest cellaring this wine for at least six years.",Stiling Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Bright acidity highlights lemonade, sour-pineapple candy and green-grass flavors in this dry, country-style Sauvignon Blanc. There's a honeyed note that would pair well with Southeast Asian fare.",Kiwi's Blend,86,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Gracianna
US,"A faint but persistent vegetal note immediately leaps out beyond the sweet black raspberries, plums and oak, showing the difficulties of the cool vintage. It's softly tannic in the mouth and dry, but not going anywhere, so drink up.",Ledbetter Family Vineyard,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"An elegant, pretty Pinot to drink now. Dry and brisk in acidity, it has a nice, silky texture framing forward raspberry, red currant and oak flavors.",,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Marked by ripe orange, apricot and mango flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc is rescued by brisk acidity that lends it a clean finish. A touch of oak adds hints of vanilla and buttered toast.",Ritchie Vineyard Requiem,86,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Genius Wines
US,"Fruity and delicious with straightforward candied pineapple and orange flavors. Oak adds notes of buttered toast, while crisp acidity provides balance.",Reserve,86,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Windsor Oaks
US,"This fresh, softly mellow and creamy wine is utterly captivating with bright summer red-berry and tree-fruit, vanilla, cherry liqueur, brown sugar and toast flavors. Absolutely delicious now, it is a silky feast for the senses and should easily negotiate the next 8–10 years.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,92,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The vineyard is near Sebastopol and the Green Valley, and the wine shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk terroir that gives the raspberry, sweet red cherry and persimmon fruit such bite. It's enormously attractive to drink now for sheer lusciousness, but has the integrity to age for 10–15 years, perhaps longer, depending on your taste for older Pinot.",Hallberg Vineyard,92,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Concentrated and elusively complex in cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors, with a hint of red tomato and bloody red meat that testifies to the cool vintage. It's a big, dense wine, but also quite tannic, and a little high in alcohol, giving it a full body. A bit ungainly now, but impressive nonetheless for sheer power. Give it six years in the cellar.",Nugent Vineyard,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stemmler
US,"This Chardonnay straddles the line between complexity and simplicity, with toasty orange and pineapple flavors brightened with citrusy acidity. Savory minerality adds interest and food friendliness.",McMinn Vineyards,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dogwood
US,"Rich and spicy, with oak-influenced green apple, pear, peach and citrus flavors, brightened with fine acidity. The finish seems pretty sweet, making the wine more off-dry than dry.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Grigio,Terlato
US,"Made in a softly appealing style, this Pinot is like cherry pie sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. It shows Pinot Noir's silky texture.",Bluffs,85,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Lots of dominating new French oak shows up in the form of smoky, vanilla-rich buttered-toast aromas and flavors. Under the oak are forward notes of pineapple jam, green apple butter and spice flavors. A little obvious in its appeal, but it will satisfy lots of Chardonnay lovers.",River Road Ranch,86,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Trione
US,"With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style.",Winery Block Estate,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"This Sauvignon Blanc impresses for subtle elegance. It's not the biggest or the fruitiest, doesn't dazzle with richness, and doesn't club you over the head with oak. Instead, it offers dryness, crisp acidity and tart green apple, lemongrass, cream and vanilla flavors.",,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"Tastes like the winemaker struggled to produce a good wine from this challenging vintage. You'll find thin, sweet cherry jam and red currant flavors alongside green minty ones, in this tart, dry Zinfandel.",Carlisle Vineyard,86,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy
US,"Strong in oak and fruit, this ripe Chardonnay features apricots, oranges and peaches. It's honeyed, but finishes dry, giving the impression of great richness.",Foggy Oaks,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"You can taste the dosage on this Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier brut in the overt sweetness that accompanies the pear, citrus and raspberry fruit flavors. With noticeable residual sugar, it's not really a dry sparkling wine, but it is delicious.",Vintage Brut,87,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Tasting rich and vital, this has a wealth of raspberry, cherry and cola flavors to the long, spicy finish. It's just what you want Pinot Noir to be: dry, silky and elegant. It doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink by 2014.",Hallberg Vineyard,90,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"This tastes soft and sweet, with citrus, green apple and apricot flavors. It's an easy wine to drink with slightly-sweet southeast Asian fare.",Top Chef,84,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Quickfire
US,"There's a streak of green unripeness that gives a vegetal note, with some polished berry and cherry flavors, too. It's unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.",Windsor Oaks Vineyard,84,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stark
US,"This is the most broadly appealing Chardonnay of Lynmar's wonderful 2011 offering. It makes all the right moves, with fine acidity and a hint of minerals giving structure to the tropical fruit, buttered toast and spice flavors. It's the kind of wine that makes Chard lovers smile. Best of all, it costs considerably less than  the winery's other Chards and is nearly as good.",,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"A good Pinot for drinking now, from a winery that's struggled with the variety. The wine is pleasant but one-dimensional in cherry, cola and cedar flavors, with crisp acids and an elegant, silky mouthfeel.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armida
US,"There's an aroma and taste of hay, or dried twigs, in this Pinot that dominates the cherry fruit. It's also pretty tannic. This undoubtedly is due to the winemaker's style, resulting in an earthy, dry wine that might develop over the next six years or so.",,87,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Terlato
US,"The bubbles are a little scoury on this delightfully dry rosé, which makes it feel rough in the mouth. Aside from that, it's rich and complex in orange, strawberry, vanilla and yeasty flavors.",Brut Rosé,87,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Marked by extreme ripeness, this Pinot is a blast of red cherry pie filling, red licorice and cola flavors, with a smoky note of bacon fat. Delicious, but a bit soft and simple in texture.",,87,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,CULT
US,"Rich and fine, this is extraordinarily decadent. Flavors of pineapple, mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and spicy oak are wrapped in a note of vanilla cream, and brightened with crisp acidity. A bit heavy and seemingly sweet, this is showing its best now.",River Block,90,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli

It's silky and tart and easy to drink now, with cranberry and sour cherry candy flavors.",Bluffs,86,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now.",Westside Farms,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"A solid, flashy Russian River Chardonnay, rich in pineapple, kiwi, tropical fruit and oak flavors, and brightened by crisp acidity. With a creamy, buttery texture, it's a solid hit down the middle of the popular style.",,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Davis Bynum
US,"Lots of toasty, caramelized oak tones combine with ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples. It seems a little sweet on the finish, but that's balanced by a swirl of acidity. Drink now.",Reserve,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Frei Brothers
US,"This is bone dry, with lots of zesty acidity and flavors of sour cherry candy, pomegranate and persimmon, with a mushroomy earthiness. It should change over the next four years, although not necessarily improving. Try pairing it with steak, lamb or a rich cut of ahi tuna.",,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"This is Sojourn's most successful 2010 Pinot Noir, because it's the ripest and most satisfying. It shows rich, tantalizing raspberry, cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by brisk acidity. It earns extra points for its complexity.",Wohler Vineyard,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn

US,"High alcohol gives this wine some porty heat, as well as glyceriney sweetness. Combined with the superripe red currant, raisin and chocolate flavors, it makes this Zin taste almost like a dessert sipper.",Gilsson Vineyard,86,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Tin Barn
US,"This is a very good price for a Zinfandel this fine. It's fairly delicate in mouthfeel for a Zin, with a light silkiness, and the tannin-acid architecture is elegant. As for the actual flavors, they're intense in red fruits, currants, sweet licorice and pepper. Hard to imagine a better wine for drinking over the next few years with barbecue.",Estate,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto
US,"Great price for a blush wine this sophisticated. Lynmar manages to tame Syrah's power and exuberance into elegant sleekness, resulting in a dry, tart wine with vibrant raspberry, orange zest and vanilla richness.",Rosé of Syrah,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Lynmar
US,"Tastes hot and peppery, in part because of high alcohol. But it's super fruity, dry and tannic, the kind of Zin that's just begging for a barbecued slab of steak or chicken, liberally slathered with sauce.",Zingaro,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Castello di Amorosa
US,"With the 2009 vintage, De Loach is at the top of its Pinot Noir game, and this one, from a chilly vineyard south of Sebastopol, is among its best ever. The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop. It should age through the next decade.",Pennacchio Vineyard,96,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"The red cherry, cola and spice flavors finish a little one-dimensional, but the mouthfeel is light and silky on this pleasant Pinot Noir. With tart acidity, it needs fatty meats like lamb or steak to balance it.",,86,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stephen & Walker
US,"There's a fresh, lilting quality to this Pinot, a silky airiness that feels weightless on the palate. Doubtless that's due to the moderate alcohol. But there's nothing light about the flavors, which are complex in black raspberry pie, softened Dr. Pepper cola, butterscotch, toast and spices. A beautiful Russian River Pinot made for drinking now with upscale fare.",,90,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Tightly wound still, this wine isn't showing much yet beyond ripe cherries, pomegranates and new oak. Firm tannins and crisp acidity provide structure, and the finish is dry and long.

The 2011, low in production, is concentrated in raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, uplifted by acidity and with a sweet jacket of toasty oak. Drink now–2019.",Bella Luna Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"The scouring mouthfeel of this wine is its biggest issue. Although it's dryish and creamy, with pleasant flavors of dough, lime, orange and vanilla, its roughness limits its score.",Blanc de Blancs,85,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Biltmore
US,"This is too oaky, but it's dry and crisp in acidity, with interesting citrus, tropical fruit and pear flavors. The heavy application of oak results in buttered toast and caramel accents.",,85,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gallo Signature Series
US,"Dry and silky, this is a good Pinot Noir, though it's a little too ripe, which gives the blackberry and cherry notes a pruny, hot taste. Try it with beef stew and prunes to echo the flavors.",Orange Label,85,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roadhouse Winery

US,"The challenges of the 2010 vintage were ample, but Longboard has succeeded with this elegant Syrah.

US,"This is the winery's most expensive Pinot, a barrel selection of its various vineyards. Its also J Vineyards' best 2010 Pinot, but they struggled with the chilly, moldy vintage. The flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, mocha, cinnamon spice and exotic sandlewood are delicious, but they feel a little heavy. Drink now.",Barrel 16 Estate,89,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Lusty, powerful, ripe and concentrated, this Zin could also be described by the old Yiddish word, zaftig. The vineyard is in a warm part of the valley, and the grapes show the influence of sun and heat in the jammy, slightly baked quality of the cherries and blackberries. It's a really fine example of Russian River Zinfandel.",Butler Vineyard,93,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"You'll find plenty of fruit, in the way of ripe mangoes, peaches, green apples and limes, as well as a sweet coating of smoky oak. However, it's elevated by brisk acidity and a stony, tangy minerality that must come from the soil of this cool-climate vineyard.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,93,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"This Syrah was grown and produced by the winery owners, and held back almost five years before release. That's an impressive act of courage, but it has benefited the consumer. The wine, while still somewhat tannic, feels mellow, with a complex array of black fruits and berries, grilled bacon, sweet tobacco, dark chocolate and, above all, freshly crushed black pepper. An impressive Syrah that should change in interesting ways over the next six years.",,93,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"De Loach has been showing a fine appreciation of dryness, acidity and minerality in its recent Chardonnays, and this single-vineyard bottling is another example of what makes these wines so drinkably good.

A rich streak of mushroomy earthiness adds to the attraction.",Black Label,90,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roadhouse Winery
US,"This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high.

US,"This is the finest of the winery's three new rosés, and kudos to them for specializing in blush. The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the wine shows long hangtime raspberry and cherry fruit, brightened with crisp acidity. It all leads to a dry, spicy finish, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.2% by volume.",Dellinger Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Ousterhout
US,"Tasted in early spring, this Chard was still tingly with acidity, but by the time you read this, everything should have calmed down.

The tannins and acids are a bit fierce, suggesting that a few years in the cellar are warranted.",Lagomarsino Vineyard,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
US,"If you open this Pinot anytime soon, give it a good decanting. Right out of the bottle, it's tight and stingy.

Decant this elegant wine for several hours before opening it.",,89,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bailiwick

US,"Similar to the 2006 vintage, this '09 is rather sweet and candied in new oaky vanilla, buttered toast, honey and caramel flavors. Underneath is plenty of ripe citrus and tropical fruit.

US,"This isn't a big Pinot Noir. It's not dark or heavy or soft. This cool part of the Russian River doesn't yield such wines. It's light in tannins and silky in the mouth, the essence of Pinot Noir.

US,"Textbook Russian River Zin, this is a big, powerful, lusty wine, with a briary, brambly profile. It's enormously complex in flavor, offering notes of fresh summer berry, cola, licorice, dark chocolate and leather that are delicious and savory.

US,"Sweet and sour acidity marks this dry wine, made from a variety that's been out of fashion for decades. With just a touch of oak, its tart tangerine, citron, lemongrass and mineral flavors star.

US,"Tannic and tightly wound, this has an astringent resistance, but because the flavors are so powerful, it's already delicious.

US,"Tough and acidic in the mouth, but with a nice silky texture, and the finish is dry. Shows cherry and raspberry flavors, alongside less ripe ones of green mint, with a touch of the veggies.",,84,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Picket Fence
US,"There's a burnt, ashy smell and taste to this wine that makes it tough to like. If you can get past that, the wine is dry, crisp and tannic, with wild cherry, cola and cedar flavors. A huge disappointment. Tasted twice.",The Whitewing Amber Ridge Vineyard,84,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
US,"Sweet and simple, with buttered popcorn, orange and pineapple juice and caramel flavors.",,84,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Picket Fence
US,"An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,97,52,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"An awesome wine. So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness. But you'll also find a firm tannic structure that gives it some astringency. It's the kind of Pinot Noir that California does at its best, drinkable now for sheer beauty, but easily capable of a decade of aging.",Klopp Ranch Méthode a L'Ancienne,96,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.",Quail Hill Vineyard Summit,96,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Merry Edwards has figured out the magic trick of crafting Pinot Noirs so luscious right out of the gate, you want to drink them now, but that actually are ageable. This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors. Yet the inherent balance of tannins and acids ensures it a long life. What a treat. Now–2016.",Flax Vineyard Méthode a L'Ancienne,96,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A fabulous, lush Pinot Noir, dry and silky. Crisp coastal acidity brightens the complex flavors of raspberries, cherries and spices, with sweet oak influences, and there's a rich tang of minerals from the earth. It's ridiculously delicious now, but with a tug of tannins, it should develop over the next six years, at least.",Quail Hill Vineyard Old Vines,95,120,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, showing sweet raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Brilliant acidity and wonderfully soft tannins make this Pinot instantly drinkable, yet it should age over the next 6–8 years.",Quail Hill Vineyard Bliss Block,94,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Brilliant acidity, dryness and tangy minerality mark this Chardonnay. The grapes come from the estate vineyard in the cool, southern part of the valley.

It's a good wine, ripe in berries and spices, but rustic.",The Tillerman,85,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Hook & Ladder
US,"There's a vegetal touch to the raspberries and cherries that compromises this Pinot Noir. It's nicely dry and crisp in acidity, with a silky texture, but it's not likely to improve with age, so drink up.",Three Sons Cuvée,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"With forward flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and cloves, this Pinot has become mellow over the years. It's a little too soft, and could use greater structure, but it's still a pretty wine. Drink up.",Horseshoe Bend Vineyard,87,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"Made in a dry, light style, this Pinot  Noir has a silky mouthfeel and citrusy acidity that gets the tastebuds whistling. It has intense flavors of sour cherry candy and Dr. Pepper, and the oak influence lends an edge of sweet toast. Seems at its best now and over the next few years. It will pair well with tuna tartare.",,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Huge Bear
US,"Oak gives this wine a caramel-like richness, while the underlying fruit is jammy and spicy in cherries and raspberries. The result is a somewhat candied Zin. Drink it now.",Gilsson Vineyard,86,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Tin Barn
US,A sugary Chardonnay whose main attraction is its honey flavor. That gives a dessert wine sweetness to the pineapple and lemon fruit. Ready now.,Reserve,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rock Wall
US,"A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014.",Allen Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"An enormous wine, rich and complex and tannic enough to cellar. Made from the estate vineyard in the Sebastopol area, it floods the mouth with savory cherry, cola, rhubarb, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors, wrapped into a silky, velvety texture. Feels classic, but you do want to give it some time. Drink 2012–2016.",Meredith Estate Méthode a L'Ancienne,94,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Fat, oily, unctuous and honeyed. Shows massive pineapple, mango, tangerine and Asian pear fruit, with a savory spiciness and plenty of sweet, smoky oak. As ripe as it is, it's saved from simplicity by brilliant acidity, a mineral cleanliness, and a thoroughly dry finish.",Heintz Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"An interesting wine. The tomato edge it shows would normally be considered a sign of unripeness, but in this case it's a delicious Heirloom variety. Conjoined with black cherries, cola and exotic mulberries, dusted with rich, Indian spices, and finished with sweet oak. Don't drink this dry, tannic and complex young wine now. It needs 5–6 years in the cellar, and could go the distance.",Zephyr Farms,94,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A rich, dramatic wine that impresses for sheer deliciousness and elegance. It's pretty much as good as the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but considerably less in price. Dry and silky, it shows beautiful acidity that makes the raspberry, cherry, cola, rhubarb, bacon and spice flavors sing. Drink now–2015.",,94,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Superrich in pineapple, lime, kiwi and tropical fruit flavors, this lovely Chardonnay has a rich, balanced overlay of sweet, smoky oak.

US,"There's lots of ripe, pure fruit in this wine, suggesting sour cherry candy, cranberries and red licorice. Texturally, it's softly silky, and the finish is dry. High alcohol shows up on the finish as a not unpleasant jalapeño-like warmth.",2 Dijon Clones,89,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Windsor Oaks
US,"This is pretty tasty in cherries, cola and licorice, with a nice, silky texture. It's a polished wine that finishes dry and spicy, with a sweet oak note on the finish. A little one dimensional, but it could develop bottle complexity over the next 6–7 years.",3 Dijon Clones,89,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Windsor Oaks

US,"Try giving this Pinot Noir 5–6 years in the cellar. It's not that it's undrinkable now, but it's immature, offering just a hint of what it wants to be. The fruit is ripe and jammy, suggesting red cherries and pomegranates, and the acidity is juicy and tart. Pinots from this vineyard are known to age well.",Keefer Ranch,89,41,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Amelle
US,"With notes of buttered toast, honey and vanilla cream, this Chardonnay is overpowered by new oak barrel influences. Beneath that are delicious fruit flavors of pineapples, oranges, pears and apricots.

Give it a good decant, and focus on what's going on in the glass.",Zeigler Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"There's something subtlely unripe about this Pinot Noir. It show up in the aroma, with a trace of stewed asparagus. Still, it's dry and elegant, and the flavors of sour cherry candy and sandalwood make it all right.",,84,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"This is a robust Pinot Noir, marked by excessive alcohol that gives it a peppery burn throughout. Beyond that, it's dry and silky, with flavors of very ripe cherry, red currant and Dr. Pepper.",Laughlin Road Ranch,86,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mara
US,"Tastes tired, with jammy tropical fruit flavors starting to drop out. Still shows vibrant acidity, but the fresh fruit character, the most likeable part of such Chardonnays, is disappearing, replaced by more herbal and vegetal notes.",Estate,85,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"The trick with Vognier is to take its exotic fruit and contain it with acidity and dryness. Swan's '09 accomplishes that task. It's big in tropical fruit and orange flavors, but crisp and minerally, and the finish turns dry and clean. A beautiful restaurant Viognier.",Catie's Corner,91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is a sort of junior version of Swan's awesome Trenton Estate Pinot. It shows the same dryness and acidity, with appealing flavors of cherries, raspberries and mushrooms. It's not quite as dense and complex, but it's a gorgeously silky Pinot Noir.",Trenton View Vineyard,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Tastes soft and almost sweet, with melted raspberry and cherry-pie-filling flavors. It's rich and oaky, but the palate lacks some grip, some structure, something to hang on to.",Lingenfelder Vineyard,85,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Brogan
US,"A Chardonnay-like wine, but more citrusy, with tangerine, lemon and mineral flavors. Oak brings sweeter complications of vanilla and buttered toast, while crisp acidity makes it all fresh and clean.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,De Loach
US,"Crunchy acidity marks this Viognier, giving it a palate brightness and making the apricot, tangerine, peach, pear and honeysuckle flavors finish drier than they probably really are. It's an exotic, rich wine that drinks well with Vietnamese fare, or a peanut-starring Cambodian beef or chicken dish.",,87,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
US,"A rich, ripe, oaky style of Chardonnay. Explosive in pineapple, tangerine, lemon and apricot jam flavors with buttered toast and honey. It's almost as sweet as a dessert wine.",,87,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sea Mist
US,"Rich, full-bodied and heavy, this is dramatic in its own way. It's certainly ripe and thick, with a flavor of black raspberry jam and a touch of milk chocolate. The high alcohol is suggestive of cherry liqueur. But that's been the Chenoweth Ranch signature for years. Drink now.",Chenoweth Ranch,88,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"This dramatically constructed Pinot wants time in the cellar. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with bigtime cherry, black raspberry, teriyaki beef and black pepper flavors, compounded with rich, smoky oak. The acidity is so acute, it will easily shepherd this wine through 5–7 years of bottle aging. Cellar Selection.",,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"Shows the racy acidity and brilliantly ripe flavors of the winery's finest Chardonnays. The pineapple, mango, pear, lime and green-apple fruit purity is massive and impressive. There's a sweet vanilla note that must come from the grapes, as no oak ever touched this lovely wine.",Unoaked,91,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Tuck this puppy into the cellar for a long time, at least six years. The tannins are fierce, a drone attack on the palate that numbs it flat. But it's very rich and sweet in raspberry essence, with good Russian River acidity. An interesting California expression of this grape variety.",Matthew's Station Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Tannat,Joseph Swan Vineyards

Near perfect for drinking now.",Cuvée de Trois,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards

US,"Made in the modern California style, new oak dominates this Chardonnay. Even though unused French barrels accounts for only 30% of the blend, the aromas and flavors of buttered toast, vanilla and caramel swamp what otherwise seems like a good, crisp, tropically fruited wine. Earns an extra point for fine minerality, the result of its pedigreed vineyard originis.",Ritchie Vineyard,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Cellar this young wine for 5–6 years to let it mellow. Right now, it's aggressive in tannins and acids. The core of cherry, black raspberry, rhubarb and plum flavors is strong, which suggests that the wine will age.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Another beautiful Chardonnay from this fine vineyard and winery. The wine is drier than past vintages, but rich in acidity and minerals, with a complex array of pineapple, lime and Meyer lemon citrus flavor. Fermenting half the wine in stainless steel and the balance in oak, a third of which was new, seems to be the perfect approach.",Heintz Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Suacci Carciere Wines
US,"A big, lusty Zin, with a blast of briary raspberry, cherry, cocoa, beef jerky, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors.

US,"One of the best Californian Pinot Gris currently available, this is rich, creamy and complex, and it would make for a great alternative to Chardonnay. This wine traditionally ages in used oak, which imparts just a hint of wood-driven sweetness to the pear, peach, mango and lime flavors.",Trenton Station Vineyard,90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Is this the first Chardonnay-Albariño blend in California? Maybe, and based on the wine, there should be more. Shows Chardonnay's cool-climate tangerine and green apple fruit, while the Albariño adds zesty acidity and a white flower, lemon tang. A brilliant wine to drink now.",Don Miguel Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Albariño,Marimar Estate
US,"At nearly five years of age, this wine tastes like it was just bottled. It's still juicy and fresh in raspberries, cherries and spices, with a sweet, clean finish. A pretty, polished and complex wine to drink now and over the next 6–8 years.",Mancini Ranch,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"We can quibble over whether the cherries are red or black, or if it's persimmons or pomegranates, or if the mushrooms are fresh or sautéed, but that's the point. This wine is so complex, it initiates discussion. Fine acidity and rich tannins provide structure, and although the wine is silky enough to enjoy now, you really want to give it 6–8 years.",West Block,96,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli

Give this 3–4 years in the cellar.",Walker Vine Hill,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Donelan

US,"The little vineyard, on the east side of the valley, is 101 years old, and was planted to a wide array of varieties, in the old Italian-American immigrant fashion. The wine is dry, complex and ageworthy. This '08 is deep in berry, spice, licorice and anise flavors, with a tang of minerals. It's fresh, vibrant and utterly distinctive. Will develop over the next decade.",Two Acres,92,43,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Carlisle
US,"The oak presently stands out, giving a blast of buttered toast, drizzled with honey. But the wine is very crisp in acidity and balanced and ripe in pineapples, pears and green apples. Could be an interesting bottle to cellar for four or five years.",,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"One of the best unoaked Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Clean and briskly acidic, it shows complex lemongrass, Meyer lemon, orange, green melon, fig, mineral and spice flavors.

US,"This interesting Pinot immediately flatters with layers of ripe fruit, pie spice and sandalwood. Then the real complexities kick in, suggesting earthy, foresty, minerally things that are almost mysterious in their brooding depths. Brisk acidity is an integral part of the equation. It's very fine now, and it could be a stunner in six years.",Armagh Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"Three Corner is a block in the estate vineyard that was planted in 1974. The 2010 is very rich and full bodied,—dramatically so—packed with cherries and pomegranates and savory spices and minerals. The power reflects the vineyard's site in a warmer part of the valley. But the wine never loses sight of elegance, and, like all Rochioli's vineyard-designated Pinot Noirs, it is in need of age. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2016, and the wine should develop for many years afterward.",Three Corner,94,80,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"This is a very rich, fruity Sauvignon Blanc, offering waves of pineapple, guava, lime, green apple and honeysuckle flavors. Crisp acidity gives it a fine tartness. Nice for drinking now with spicy tapas appetizers.",,87,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Novy
US,"With just a touch of oak providing creamy vanilla flavors, this wine's real stars are the lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors, which have such a pretty minerality. It's a little sweet, but refreshing acidity balances that out.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Longboard

Finishes honey sweet, but a nice edge of acidity provides needed balance.",Westside Farms,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"This is a delicious Pinot Noir, packed with cherries and raspberries, with a deft touch of oak. Shows a light, delicate structure, like satin, with the richness brightened by tart acidity. Defines the elegant, drink-me-now Pinot style, but it should develop well over the next six years.",Dutton Ranch Campbell Vineyard,93,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
US,"This shows the tense acidity and dry minerality that make young Marimar Estate Chardonnays so brisk and fresh. It's as elegant as Chardonnay gets, with a racy mouthfeel and rich, subtle tropical fruit and pear flavors.

Drink it now for maximum freshness.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani

Should age well for 10 years.",Litton Estate Vineyard,98,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

The tangerine, pineapple and vanilla bean flavors are brightened with brisk acidity.",Trenton Station,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Keefer Ranch Pinots often start off brooding and tannic. Failla's 2010 is modeled in this style, but it has enormous core flavors of blackberry, soft cola and foresty things. This should reward patience; hold until 2016, at least.",Keefer Ranch,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"A big, bold Pinot Noir, this is filled with raspberry, cherry, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. It's a fruit store in the glass.

Should hold in the bottle for 4–5 years.",Robert Thomas Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery

It's vibrant in acidity, with a beautifully silky texture, but at this point, it's a little direct.

Needs rich meats and cheeses. Could even improve in the cellar for a few years.",Saralee's Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Arrowood
US,"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey notes, with a touch of sweet, smoky oak.

US,"With flavors of cherry and raspberry sap, this is a syrupy young wine made brisk by keen acidity. Oak adds to the impression of sweetness, with a buttered toast and caramelized richness.

US,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste.

Delicious and appealing.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Rich and silky, but a little heavy and soft.

But there's a certain direct quality. Drink now.",Jenkins Vineyard,87,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A bit over the top in fruity extraction, a bomb blast of sweet raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. It's almost like a dessert wine. Yet there's a lot of tannins and acidity, and who knows? It could do interesting things. At this price, buy a bottle and stick it in the cellar for six years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,87,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Good, rich and spicy Zin from Williams Selyem winemaker Bob Cabral. It's not the most memorable Bacigalupi ever, with a somewhat soft, simple structure.

US,"The Fog Crest bottling is a blend of various vineyards. It's a dependable wine that can approach the Estate bottling in richness—although it never quite gets there. The 2010 is ripe, bearing raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink now.",Laguna West,90,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fog Crest
US,"Rich, ripe and classy, this shows real pedigree in its structure, with brisk acids, firm tannins and a hint of minerals providing the architecture for the cherry and pomegranate flavors. It finishes totally dry and is ready to drink now.",Russian River Selection,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Nicely dry, with a tart cut of citrusy acidity that cleanses the mouth and would certainly cut through the fattiness of lamb or beef dishes. It's tannic, too, with a good stuffing of cherries. Hard to know where it's going in the future, so drink up over the next few years.",9 Barrel,90,90,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"More tannicly dense than Failla's estate Sonoma Coast bottling, this Pinot wants a few years in the cellar. You can drink it now because it's so delicious in cherry and raspberry fruit, but there's a tightness, an astringency that suggests 3-4 years to come around. If you pop the cork now, give it a few hours of decanting.",Keefer Ranch,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.",Zio Tony Ranch,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"With no oak, there's nothing here but natural grape flavors of oranges, limes, green apples, pears and golden mangoes. The acidity is high and racy. Ready now, but don't drink it too cold.",Acero Don Miguel Vineyard Unoaked,89,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Here's a rich, spicy Pinot Noir for drinking now. Dry and silky, it has plenty of ripe raspberry, cherry, cola and rhubarb fruit, with a good application of sweetly toasted oak. Could be a little crisper, which limits ageworthiness.",,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"Rich and pure in tropical fruit, pear and apricot flavors, this Chardonnay also has a sweet jacket of toasty oak. It's a fine wine, buttery and crisp in acidity. Drink now.",Lorenzo Vineyard,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Follette
US,"A bit brittle, with big acidity and a tension of green fruit and cherries. Oak certainly helps, providing smoky vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast richness, but the stemmy flavors don't go away.",Peters Vineyard,86,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Amphora
US,"Rather tannic and dense now, with an astringent mouthfeel, and the fruit hasn't yet married the oak. Give it until 2011 to let the raspberries, cherries, orange peel and cola find the vanilla char from wood.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"This is a very pure, fresh and clean Chardonnay. While it's rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and smoky oak flavors, it's also well balanced. Shows brisk, citrusy acidity and a firm stream of minerals.",O.F.S.,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"As weighty as a Chardonnay, this is a Sauvignon Blanc whose nuances will be killed if you over-chill it. You could even decant it for a while and let it approach room temperature. Dry and rich, it shows savory, complex tiers of pineapples, limes, green apples, sweet golden tobacco, vanilla, white pepper and even a touch of thyme.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"Young, vibrant and fresh, this wine's crisp acidity frames pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, with a slight hint of botrytis in the form of golden apricot and honey. There's lots of evident oak, creating a buttered toast note, while its minerality makes it complex. Vastly rich, if a little lacking in subtlety. Drink now.",Keefer Ranch,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla

It's a pretty Pinot Noir for drinking now.",Suacci Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Suacci Carciere Wines
US,"Charm marks this young Pinot Noir. It's softly luscious and delicious in raspberry and cherry jam, cola and sandalwood flavors. The acid-tannin structure is just fine. It shows a candied directness now, but you may want to cellar it for 5–6 years and see how it develops.",Little Hill,90,72,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Shows some of the richness and complexity of Migration's single-vineyard Chardonnays, but at much less money. The wine is dry, crisp and flavorful in pineapples, green apples, limes and honeysuckle, with oaky notes of buttered toast. Drink now.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Migration
US,"Primitivo seldom has the elegance of true Zinfandel, and so it is here. Despite a resemblance to wild berry and spice flavors, the mouthfeel is rustic, and the finish is sweet.",Ottimino Vineyard Little 8,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Primitivo,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"This unoaked wine is bone dry, tart in acidity, low in alcohol and intricate with citrus, pear and mineral flavors. What a nice wine for a cocktail sipper or for anything ranging from Thai to Mexican to simple picnic fare.",,89,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Inman Family
US,"A little gritty in texture, and the rawness is compounded by black pepper tartness. Yet there's a huge, succulent core of black cherry fruit, and the wine is perfectly dry and acidic. An interesting Pinot, one to stash in the cellar and see what happens.",Graham Family Vineyard,88,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"An ambitious wine that explores new blending territory. Shows fine structure, with brisk acidity and smooth tannins framing ripe cherry fruit, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Lacks a certain finesse, but definitely a worthwhile venture by the winery, and a wine to watch.",Don Miguel Vineyard,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah-Tempranillo,Marimar Estate
US,"With a taste of white sugar and honey, this Chardonnay can't really be described as dry. But it is clean and vibrant in acidity, with rich pineapple jam and green apple flavors, and the underlying tang of minerals helps to ground it.",Proprietor's Reserve,86,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rutz
US,"Merriam is concentrating on Cabernet Franc from various appellations, with excellent results. This Russian River bottling is terrific for drinking now. It's spicy and rich in red cherry jam, cherry liqueur and smoky sandalwood flavors that finish long and sweet. It would be great with Chinese-style roast pork.",Windacre Vineyard Estate,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Merriam
US,"This is initially tight and closed, needing to be decanted to reveal its generous black cherry and persimmon flavors, plus lots of peppery spice. The texture is silky, yet there are some hefty tannins, suggesting the wine might improve over the next 5–6 years, even though it's drinkable now.",Bush Crispo Vineyards,91,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Ram's Gate
US,This will divide the Zinfandel community. Some will find its earthiness and herbaceousness an attractive complication to the briary berry and spice notes. Others will think it's not quite ripe enough and lacking richness. The score reflects the wine's complexity and adaptability to a wide range of foods.,Ponzo,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ridge

US,"With a gentle, silky texture, this is a lovely Pinot Noir to drink now. Tart acidity gives the cherry and pomegranate flavors a sour candy savoriness. Elegant and charming, it's a nice partner for steak, lamb chops, grilled tuna.",,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Graton Ridge
US,"The main thing about this Pinot Noir is the richness. It's bold and sumptuous, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, pomegranates, persimmons and cola, accented by oak and brightened by brisk acidity. With its delicious finish, it's a pretty wine to drink now.",Bella Luna Vineyard,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"Tough in acidity and tannins, this Pinot is notable for its structure rather than its opulence. There's an earthy, mushroomy edge to the concentrated black-cherry and cola flavors. You can drink it now if you want, but it should mellow with a few years in the cellar.",Olivet Grange Vineyard,89,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Inman Family
US,"A little reedy, with unripe mint flavors and some sharpness. Redeems itself on the midpalate with a hit of cherries and cola, then reprises the sharpness on the finish. Ready now.",,85,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"This is a very dry, silky Pinot Noir made in a more restrained manner than some of the big, huge ones out there. It doesn't whack your head, but appeals for its elegance. Shows sophisticated cherry, sassafras and sandalwood flavors, and the price is extremely good for the quality.",,90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pedroncelli
US,"A good everyday Zinfandel whose full-bodied, spicy fruitiness will satisfy with barbecue. It's a rugged, somewhat rustic wine with briary flavors of wild blackberries, leather, cola and pepper. Drink now.",Conte Vineyard,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
US,"Here's a big, gutsy Syrah that's ripe in blackberries, but also a little ungainly. There are some raisiny flavors as well as minty ones, giving it the taste of a Chinese sweet and sour cherry sauce.",Christensen Family Vineyard,85,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results. The wine is dry, silky and interesting, showing an array of cherry, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors. Has enough of a complex tannin structure to pair with lamb chops, or a great grilled salmon steak.",,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
US,"A strongly flavored Pinot, this has plenty of saturated cherry-jam fruit. Tart acidity and some chili pepper heat from the alcohol contribute to the mouthfeel, while oak brings a toast note. This is likely to be best over the next few years.",Gunsalus Vineyard,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"The cool vintage has given this wine lots of perky acidity and dry tannins as well as an earthy, mushroomy quality to the blackberry and cherry flavors. Probably best enjoyed soon, but give it a decant before serving.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This Pinot tastes so oaky, it's like chewing on barrel staves. Notes of vanilla, buttered toast and the creamy-sweet flavor of oak sap completely overwhelm what otherwise seems like a good wine. This is a real outlier among MacPhail's other 2010 Pinot Noirs.",The Flyer,85,59,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A good, rich, village-style Pinot Noir with some real class, especially in the structure. The flavors of cola, cherries, red currants, licorice and cocoa are just fine, but it's the crispness and silky tannins that lift it up.",Heintz Ranch,89,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutch Bill Creek
US,"This is a fun, easy drinker, showing zippy acidity and lots of mouthwatering clove and vanilla notes that frame flavors of Asian pear, orange and honeysuckle. It tastes just a bit off-dry, but it's refreshing and will pair well with Vietnamese and Ethiopian poultry-based dishes.",,90,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Courtney Benham
US,"The chilly vintage has produced a very dry, young wine whose flavors veer toward acid-inspired mineral, citrus peel and apricots, rather than the riper flavors of a warmer year, such as 2008. The result is a tight Chardonnay, one more geared for revealing complexities than for opulence.",Ruxton Vineyard,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lost Canyon
US,"This is opulent, dry and full bodied, with a rich network of tannins framing ripe flavors of cherries, red currants and sandalwood. Subtle trace notes of greenness suggest it's not an ager; drink now.",,88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Suacci Carciere Wines
US,"A vegetal touch marks this wine, which otherwise shows flavors of sour cherry candy and rhubarb.",Clone 667,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Windsor Oaks
US,"A pretty good Chardonnay, dry and crisp and minerally. It comes from this famous vineyard in the heart of the southern valley, and shows proper flavors of green apples and peaches, with a firm minerality and fine acidity. Not particularly rich, but interesting and complex, and a good companion to food.",Saralee's Vineyard Reserve,88,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"A decent Pinot, but a bit funky and sharp. Although this Pinot has jammy raspberry flavors, the mouthfeel is awkward, and the finish is simple and sweet. Disappointing from this prestigious winery.",Russian River Selection,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"This is so softly sweet and delicious in mocha, wild berry, buttery nougat and spice flavors, it's like a candy bar with alcohol. Easy to drink, with a gentle mouthfeel.",,85,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto
US,"Great price for a Pinot Noir this rich and fancy. It really flatters the palate, offering waves of raspberry, cherry, root beer, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, with a spicy finish. The light, silky texture is especially nice, as is the low alcohol balance.",Appellation Series,90,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Healdsburg Ranches
US,"A lovely Zinfandel, dry and elegant and balanced. Yet it preserves Zin's briary, brambly character, with wild berry, currant, cola and pepper flavors. Really savory and a delight to drink.",Cool Climate Vineyards,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Dry, tart and citrusy. Offers streamlined flavors of lemons, limes, tannic herb tea and minerals, with oak and lees adding much-needed richness. It's elegant in a Chablisian way, but trades fruity opulence for a more complex, connoisseur's austerity. Drink now, and don't over-chill.",Durell Vineyard,88,53,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tor Kenward
US,"Easy to drink, this has enough sophistication to pair with rich scallop, tuna and lobster dishes. It's dry, although there's a lot of sweetly ripe orange, apricot and buttercream flavors, as well as caramelized oak. Brisk acidity fortunately brings a crisp, balanced edge.",,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jordan
US,"This is exotic in grapefruit, apricot and honey flavors, with a green veggie streak that's courtesy of the chilly vintage. It's best described as tasting like a sweet-and-sour Chinese sauce.",,85,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Novy
US,"A problematic wine, especially considering the price. It's dark in color, quite tannic and bone dry, with powerful cherry and cola flavors, liberally accented with smoky oak. Has all the hallmarks of an ageable young Pinot Noir, but there's a stubbornly unripe streak of green peppercorn all the way through. Difficult and risky to predict where this wine is going.",Nine Barrel,87,90,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"Fruity extract marks this big flavored, jammy wine, brimming with raspberries and cherries. It shows a modern approach to grapegrowing and winemaking, designed to satisfy palates, but it could use some old-fashioned complexity. Might develop in the bottle over the next 3–5 years.",Chenoweth Ranch,87,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"A good, flavorful Pinot Noir that shows exceptionally ripe cherry and sassafras fruit, balanced with fine tannins. It's a little on the soft side. Drink now, with lamb and roasted potatoes.",Open-top Vat Fermentation,88,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"This is a very rich Syrah, dramatically layered in blackberry, bitter cherry skin, dark chocolate, grilled prosciutto and pepper flavors. Despite the richness, it's bone dry, with refined tannins and fine acidity. It's somewhat light in body, like a Pinot Noir, which makes it especially drinkable.",,89,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"An interesting and challenging wine. Shows some funky, mushroomy notes, along with flavors of cherries, cola, rhubarb and green tomato jam, accompanied by high acidity. It's Burgundian, in its own way, and could develop in the bottle. Now–2014.",,89,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Terlato
US,"A dependable Chardonnay, ripe and opulent in pineapple, crème brûlée, vanilla cream, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Could and should be drier, as it exceeds the sweetness speed limit, but will satisfy fans of this ripe California style.",,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,White Oak
US,"Tastes young and strong in primary fruit flavors—cherries, raspberries and spicy cola, accented with the caramel and vanilla of toasted oak. Impeccably balanced in tannins and acids, this wine should develop bottle interest over the next 3–5 years.",Chenowith Ranch,88,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"A flavorful, well-made Pinot for drinking now. Has a nice, silky texture, with brisk acidity framing savory raspberries, cherries, cola, vanilla and exotic sandalwood.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Simple and sweet, with raspberry and cola flavors, this Pinot has a lot to offer. But it lacks structure and dryness. Drink now.",Lauterbach Hill,85,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stomping Girl
US,"A little sharp and awkward in the mouth, with some green flavors leading to a tart finish. There are enough berry, cherry and oak flavors to make the wine interesting. Shows a classy dryness, but doesn't seem to have the balance to age. Drink up.",Maboroshi Vineyard,86,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Cru Vin Dogs
US,"Super-ripe and dry, with raisin and Port flavors wrapped into 16.5% alcohol. It's a good example of what it is, but certainly exceeds balance.",,82,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
US,"Although this Zin has a touch of overripeness in the form of raisins covered in chocolate, followed by a lot of blackberry and foxy mulberry. The wine is dry, smooth and balanced, with plenty of complexity.",,89,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"Already tasting a little old and tired, with the fruit fading and turning mushroomy. But it's not unpleasant, with a dried fruit spiciness. Drink quickly before it disappears.",Saralee's Vineyard,84,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"With brisk acidity and upfront fruit, this is ready to drink. The pineapple, pear and oak flavors are housed in a creamy mouthfeel.",Russian River Selection,87,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Showing sweet toasty oak, brisk acidity and pure flavors of citrus fruit and apricot, this is a very rich, dry Chardonnay, although all of its parts haven't quite come together. While it's not an ager, it will benefit from holding until mid-2013, but not any longer.",Horseshoe Bend Vineyard,89,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"There's something ruggedly luscious about this Cab Franc. It's not an ager or particularly complicated, but it does offer up a panoply of ripe red and black currants, anise, dark chocolate and spice flavors. It finishes dry, balanced and charming.",Alegria Vineyard,87,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Acorn
US,"A good, rich Chardonnay, marked by pleasantly crisp acidity and a buttercreamy texture housing fruity flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples and kiwi. Shows good Russian River character. Don't drink it too cold.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,White Oak
US,"Tastes grapey, with green table grape, pineapple, vanilla and spice flavors, and the finish is totally dry and crisp. It's a good, rich, savory wine, rather like a Pinot Gris, at a good price.",Old Vines,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Colombard,Y Rousseau
US,"A terrific Zinfandel, with a polished, pretty structure and ripe, vibrantly classic Zinny flavors. Floods the mouth with berries, cola, licorice, mocha and dusty spices, wrapped into beautifully fine, ripe tannins. Impossible to resist sip after sip. Defines Russian River Zinfandel at its best.",Belloni Single Vineyard,94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"The vintage was very kind to Chardonnay, and the balance shows in the fantastically ripe, exotic pineapple tart, lemondrop candy, buttered toast, sandalwood and sweet, dusty spice flavors of this immaculately dry, crisp wine. It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,94,41,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"This is a very pretty, polished wine for drinking now. It has rich, creamy flavors of tropical fruit and sweet, smoky oak that are brightened by crisp acidity.",Reserve,88,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Off a pace or two from the '05, but still shows plenty of ripe, fruity flavor. The jammy cherries and blackberries have rich notes of orange zest, licorice and smoky vanilla.",Estate,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Balletto
US,"Shows the fine varietal characteristics of dryness, silkiness and fruitiness you want in a nice Russian River Pinot, with suggestions of cherries, currants, root beer and smoky oak. There's also a streak of wintergreen tartness that seems to limit the cellar-worthiness. Best now and through 2010.",,86,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,C. Donatiello
US,"Tastes more like Zinfandel than Syrah, with intense black pepper, wild berry, currant and leather flavors, but that aside, it's a pretty good wine. Dry and tannic, it calls for barbecue.",Alegria Vineyard Axiom,86,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"If you like those dry, acidic New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs, with their gooseberry aromas and flavors, this wine's for you. It shows enough lemon, lime and white flower ripeness to give it rich interest.",,86,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
US,"A big, young Pinot Noir that shows brilliant stuffing and complexity, but it's rather heavy and tannic now, and not a wine to open before, say, 2011 at the very least. In its youth it displays rich, jammy flavors of red cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood, and is very dry. Should evolve slowly through 2015 or beyond.",Starr Ridge Vineyard - Dijon Clones,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"With hints of dried hay, white pepper, lemon, Asian pear and mineral that are brightened by searing acidity, this elegant, bone-dry wine will complement food—not dominate it.",Estate Bottled,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Foppiano
US,"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit.",Reserve,85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Here's a sweetly delicious young Pinot whose flavors are designed to please. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam, anise, cola, pepper and sandalwood notes, brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Windsor Sonoma
US,"Fruity and simple, with a bubblegummy sweetness to the raspberries and cherries. Pleasant rather than complex, and not likely an ager.",,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma-Loeb
US,"Easily the best MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir ever. Shows impressive depth and complexity, with rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, pomegranates, persimmons and smoky sandalwood, finished with tangy Asian spices. Tastes a bit jammy, suggesting a few years in the bottle.",Winemaker's Block Selection,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"Right out of the bottle, this is tight and acidic. While it's rich in raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors, not to mention oak, it's jammy, fresh and direct—in an immature way. Give it a few hours in a decanter and drink it with rich lamb and steak dishes.",Horseshoe Bend Vineyard,88,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Occidental Road Cellars
US,"There's a Floodgate Vineyard in Anderson Valley that produces very nice Pinot Noirs, but this one says it's from Russian River Valley. This wine is average in quality. It has a fine, silky mouthfeel, with some good cherry flavors, but also a sharp, green touch of mint that's unlikely to age out.",Floodgate Vineyard Old Vines,85,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,C. Donatiello
US,"Shows rich flavors and a creamy texture, with pineapple-infused crème brûlée, buttered cinnamon bun and honey. Could be more focused and crisper in structure.",,85,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Cuvée
US,"A sound, everyday Pinot that's dry and silky and fruity. With pleasant cherry, cola, wintergreen, vanilla and spice flavors, it's a bit scoury in texture.",Boschetti Vineyard,85,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,River Road
US,"Pretty good, but at this price, a bit heavy and over-extracted for a Pinot Noir, almost Grenache-like. The flavors are black peppery, with an underground stream of black cherries and oak, and the tannins close in on the finish.",Reserva,85,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Esterlina
US,"The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer.",Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard,95,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"So rich, so opulent, this is fantastic to enjoy now. It really nails it, with intricate flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch, honey and vanilla that ride high on top of the pineapple and tropical fruit flavors. The winery is best known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but with this release, it's competing at the highest level of quality Chardonnay.",,94,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Parallel
US,"The winery's '08 bottling of this Pinot was very good, but this is considerably better. It's rich in red cherries and ripe persimmons, with complex notes of grilled beef, cola and sautéed wild mushrooms, and has a long, spicy finish. A joy to drink now, and it will develop bottle nuances over the next six years.",Horshehoe Bend Vineyard,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"Give this fresh young Pinot a year to mellow. Right now, it's jammy in raspberries and cherries, with a citric sharpness. Needs brief time to knit together and become seamless.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"A beautiful wine, dry, complex and crisp, and easily one of the best white Rhône-style bottlings of the vintage. It shows brilliantly clean acidity that provides a brisk mouthfeel to the apricot, pineapple and pear flavors that rest on a firm ground of minerals. Great as a richer, more exotic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.",Saralee's Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Eric Ross
US,"A very pale wine, barely more than a rosé in hue, but very flavorful. Enraptures the palate with vanilla-scented raspberry Newton, orange biscotti, cola, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that swirl into a long, spicy finish. Not an ager, but perfect now with grilled salmon or a fine ham.",Saralee's Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Eric Ross
US,"A bit on the green, feline side, but with enough lemon and lime and sweet oak influences to give it richness. The acidity is wonderful, like biting into a fresh Granny Smith apple.",Reserve,85,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Frei Brothers
US,"With waves of raspberry, cherry, honeyed cream, cinnamon and caramelized oak flavors, this defines the word delicious. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity and delicate tannins. Just superb to drink now; try pairing it with lamb that's been salted and peppered, seasoned with a hint of rosemary.",Starr Ridge Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"This late-released bottling is incredibly interesting. Connoisseurs will appreciate the bone-dry minerality and acidity, the subtle creaminess from lees aging and the citrusy flavors that just begin to suggest tropical fruit. It should continue to develop in the bottle for a few more years.",Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"This is so seductive in rich, polished raspberry and cherry flavors, you can hardly keep from drinking it now. But the acid and tannin balance on this Pinot Noir is just about perfect, giving it the potential for at least six years in a good cellar. There's an earthy, mushroomy complexity that could make it really interesting down the road.",Queste,93,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,TR Elliott
US,"This is a tremendously ripe Zinfandel whose alcohol level, of nearly 16%, gives it a Porty aroma and taste. Dry and tannic, it will violate some peoples' sense of balance, but really defines this triumphant style.",Mancini Ranch,85,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"A nice Chardonnay that shows ripe pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, with added smoky richness from oak, and the finish is dry and crisp. A good price for a wine of this quality.",,87,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lake Sonoma
US,"Soft and simple, with canned apple and pear flavors and a heavy dose of sweet, charry oak.",,84,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,C. Donatiello
US,"Delicious and spicy, this has notes of cherry pie filling, cola, dried forest herb and leaf, with a touch of sweet, smoky, vanilla-tinged oak. It's a bit on the brawny side, but then, these Keefer Ranch Pinots always start out that way. Don't drink it now because it's just too hefty; give it six years in a proper cellar.",Keefer Ranch,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Fruity and oaky, with rich flavors of pineapples, pears, buttercream, vanilla cookie and toasty meringue. Crisp acidity provides clean balance.",,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"If this wine were drier and crisper it would be a lot finer. The flavors are very rich, suggesting ripe pineapple tart, Meyer lemon pie, vanilla and sweet butter. It's almost sugary, except it's probably technically dry.",Dutton Ranch - Kylie's Cuvee,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"Dry, crisp and herbal, with tobacco, cola, red licorice and tannic cherryskin flavors. A silky, polished Pinot for early drinking.",,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Minty and sharp in acidity, and not offering much richness now, especially at this price, although it does feel stylishly dry and elegant. Shows proper cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"Sweet and oaky, this Chard tastes like a vanilla and caramel cream soda, with alcohol and a squirt of pineapple essence. Defines the superripe, opulent style, without much complexity.",,86,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paoletti
US,"This Chard is soft and sweet, very ripe in jammy white and yellow fruit flavors, and has a smoky-oak coating. It's made in a style meant to appeal to consumers.",Christie Vineyard,84,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,C. Donatiello
US,"A beautiful Pinot to drink now, this is elegant and supple, with crisp acidity and a delightfully light texture. However, there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest wild forest berry, softened cola, mushroom, dried pine and spice, enhanced with a subtle jacket of sandalwood.",,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"A consummate Russian River Pinot Noir in an accessible style. This is simply enchanting, like raspberry-infused silk dusted with brown butter, cinnamon and vanilla. Showing just beautifully now, this is soft and gentle, and it should glide through the next six years.",,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"With a creamy mouthfeel and ripe flavors of tangerines, tropical fruits, honey and sweet oak, this is a flashy effort. It will appeal to fans of the variety, and rightfully so, delivering a dry complexity that lifts it way above the average.",,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Migration
US,"Lots of ripe, cheerful flavors of raspberry and cherry jam and cola are found in this vibrant wine. It shows oak, too, in the form of sweet buttered cinnamon toast. The mouthfeel is pure Pinot: silky, velvety and delicate. Delicious for drinking now with everything from grilled steak to ahi tuna.",,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lucie
US,"A hard wine to like. It's very dry and somewhat overripe, with a pruny, raisiny edge, and the acidity sticks out in a harsh way. This also is the highest alcohol wine of Benziger's trio of 2008 Pinot Noirs, and it feels hot in an unbalanced way.",San Remo Vineyard Signaterra,84,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benziger
US,"This very rich, ripe and forward Pinot Noir can be opened now for its vast array of raspberries, cherries, cola, red licorice and smoky sandalwood. It grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, showing facets of pomegranates and violets. Will provide good drinking through 2014.",Karmen Isabella,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Pretty severe, an acidic, raspingly dry wine and even a tannic one. Shows an astringency rare in Chardonnay, even though there are some good pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Not an ager.",Searby Vineyard,85,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nickel & Nickel
US,"Too acidic and tart in wintergreen flavors, a real disappointment from this well-regarded vineyard. On the plus side, it's bone dry and silky, and shows cherry and cola flavors accented with sweet, smoky oak. Ready to drink now.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,85,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Released at the age of nearly four years, this wine tastes a little sweet and tired, like melted apricot jam sprinkled with vanilla and cinnamon, with dried fruit and herbal notes. Drink now before it goes further downhill.",The Cutrer,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"This is delicious in raspberry and cherry jam and cola flavors, with a mushroom and grilled hamburger note that adds to its appeal. Dry and crisp, it could develop complexity over the years, but there's no reason not to give it a decanting and enjoy it now.",Soul Patch,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"Made in a New Zealand style, with strong gooseberry, lemongrass and lime flavors, this wine is bone dry and exceptionally crisp in acidity. It gets the tastebuds watering.",,85,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
US,"Lots to admire about this polished Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky in the mouth, with voluptuous flavors of raspberries, cherries, currants, licorice and cola. You'll also find plenty of zesty acidity. Needs some time to knit together and mellow. Better by late 2010 or 2011.",,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stewart
US,"There's lots of mouthwatering acidity in this bone-dry Pinot Noir, with an ample supply of ripe fruit in the form of raspberries and cherries. There's also something wonderfully earthy, like roasted mushrooms splashed with balsamic and tamari sauce. The cool 2010 vintage was kind to Bacigalupi Vineyard, which can produce overripe wines in hot years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Von Holt
US,"This is White Oak's best Chardonnay in years. The wine benefited from the chilly vintage, expressing citrus and tropical fruit flavors while preserving its vital acidity. It shows real elegance.",Estate Grown,92,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,White Oak
US,"This still immature Pinot has tobacco-infused cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors that are liberally oaked and spiced. It's O.K. to drink immediately if you like freshness and vibrancy, but aging it for six years or even longer could reward.",Nugent Vineyard,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stemmler
US,"Smells and tastes Porty, with smokey, caramelized wood and intense black currant flavors. It's not exactly sweet, but high alcohol gives that glyceriney impression.",Tom Feeney Ranch Old Vine,83,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Starry Night
US,"This is one of the driest wines Marimar Estate ever has produced—in a good sense. The cool vintage has made the Chardonnay minerally and sleek, while Albariño brings its usual lemony crispness. The result is a versatile, stylishly elegant wine.",Don Miguel Vineyard,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Albariño,Marimar Estate
US,"Tries for Burgundian richness, but ends up rather common, although it will satisfy fans of buttery, oaky Chardonnays. Shows ripe flavors of pineapple jam, apricot purée and buttered popcorn.",,85,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutch Bill Creek

US,"A polished, elegant and delicious Pinot. New, smoky oak frames ripe, jammy blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and orange flavors, with richer notes of chocolate, figs and grilled meat. Impeccably balanced with acidity, this wine should hold and develop over the next six years.",Mononi,94,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Failla has a great track record with this vineyard, which is source to many wineries. The '06 is fresh and vibrant, and needs a little time to develop. It shows classic balance, with rich tannins, crisp acidity and brilliantly ripe, oak-inspired flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola and currants. As delicious as it is now, it's nervous and tentative. Give it a few years to come around.",Keefer Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla

Shows plush flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, blood oranges, cola and peppery spices that are wrapped into a rich, silky mouthfeel. This dry, complex wine is a joy to drink.",Dutton Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rutz
US,"Right up there with the rich '08, Elliott's 2009 offers plenty of serious tasting pleasure.

Dry and silky, it's a classy Pinot Noir for drinking over the next several years.",Burgonet,91,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,TR Elliott
US,"Thin and acidic, with just the barest suggestion of grapefruit juice. Maybe some pineapples. Earns an extra point or two for dryness and elegance, but really lacks richness.",,85,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jordan
US,"Accomplishes the impossible, stunning the palate with the most delicious flavors imaginable, yet with the structural integrity to age. Those flavors intoxicate with cherry pie, black raspberry tart, tangerine zest and mocha, finished with exotic spicebox and sweet, charred new oak smokiness, all enveloped in sheer silkiness and ultrarefined tannins. Drink now–2018.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,97,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Dry and exceptionally rich, this has a fleshiness that suggests it could use some time in the cellar. It's strongly ripe in wild raspberries and cherries, with a spicy, minty pine note that's attractive. Mouthwatering acidity suggests this can use 4–6 years of aging, but it can also be consumed now.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Furthermore
US,"Crisp and fruity, with lemon, lime, pineapple and spice flavors, brightened with mouth-cleansing acidity. Yet it's a bit too strong in those feline pyrazines that lend a green, unripe taste.",Ritchie Vineyard,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,De Loach
US,"A little one-dimensional, but for an everyday sipper, it's pretty good for the price. Shows slightly sweet, juicy pineapple, peach, kiwi fruit and Asian pear flavors.",,85,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Windsor Sonoma
US,"Feels rough in the mouth, because the bubbles are big and scoury, not small and fine. But the wine is nicely dry and very clean, with pleasant orange and lime flavors.",Natural,85,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Korbel

US,"The Freestone Hill bottling is one of Dutton Goldfield's biggest and most powerful Pinot Noirs, and the '06 is nearly as stunning as the magnificent '05. It just explodes in the mouth with succulent cherry and raspberry pie, mocha and spicy anise and pepper flavors, with fabulous complexities from smoky oak. Terrific now, but the tannins will hold it for a decade.",Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard,94,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield

US,"A lush Chardonnay marked by the integrated balance of all its parts, resulting in great harmony. It's very ripe in tropical fruits and quite oaky and leesy, but like the powerful gymnasts at Cirque du Soleil, all the performers work together as a troupe. Drink with rich, fancy fare, like lobster or scallops.",Dutton Ranch,92,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall

US,"This is the winery's most expensive Chardonnay, and it's also easily their best. It shows the ripe, flashy opulence that makes Chardonnay America's favorite white, with an array of pineapple and orange pie flavors.

US,"This is the least successful of De Loach's otherwise brilliant new range of Zinfandels, for one simple reason: it's overripe. The alcohol is an astounding 16.5%, and the wine has flavors of raisins and prunes.",Butler Vineyard,84,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Oaky-sweet and simple, with jammy pineapple, tropical fruit and honey flavors. The best thing is brisk acidity and a clean finish.",Appellation Series,84,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Healdsburg Ranches
US,"This is a rare premier release from the winery's new vineyard. It's a blend of different clones, and only 47 cases were produced. The wine is very exotic. It shows tiers of raspberries and cherries, but also more feral notes, of dried meats or leather, mushrooms, tart balsam, tangy minerals and scads of dusty, sweet Indian spices. Tannic and dry, it should unfold slowly over the next 10 years.",Block 10 Mass Selection Estate Vineyard,94,68,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The Russian River Valley makes some of the state's greatest Sauvignon Blancs, in the right hands, and when those hands are Merry Edwards', you can be sure of what you're getting. The wine is dry and crisp in mouthwatering acidity, with citrus and lemongrass flavors that have richer tones of tropical fruits. It feels vibrant, elegant and complex in the mouth, a wine to savor over multiple glasses.",,93,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Merry Edwards
US,"Seemingly sweet and light bodied, this features raspberry, vanilla, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. It's a delicious wine in the way of a granola candy bar. Drink now.",,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sequana
US,"This variety has long been planted in California as a blending grape, often with Zinfandel. On its own, as it is here, it's soft and candied-tasting, with flavors of raspberry and red cherry, set off by brisk acidity and firm tannins in a light-bodied texture. A little rustic, it needs to be paired with rich fare, such as steaks or lamb chops, to become balanced.",Alegria Vineyards,86,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Alicante Bouschet,Acorn
US,"This is nice and dry, with a silky texture, firm acidity and classic cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors. But it finishes on the slender side.",,86,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Foppiano
US,"The winery has been on a roll the last few years with Zinfandels that not only are delicious, but show real class. With this bottling. V. Sattui captures the essence of ripe, heady Russian River Zinfandel. Yes, the alcohol is high, but that's Zinfandel for you, and without it you wouldn't have that ripe, spicy berry-pie flavor that's as soft as candy. Ready to drink now.",Gilsson Vineyard,90,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,V. Sattui
US,"Minty and green, a hard, acidic wine only somewhat relieved by cherry and oak flavors. Not bad, but pretty lean.",,83,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Angeline
US,"The Allen bottling typically needs time to come around. This '06 shows the dusty tannins that close it down a bit in its youth, suggesting a good five years in the cellar. Silky and refined, it should evolve to a fine wine, with its cherry pie, mocha, cola and spice flavors. If you drink now, decant. Beautiful with a fine grilled steak.",Allen Vineyard,93,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Burning hot in alcohol, this Zin is totally dry. It has peppery flavors of shriveled grapes and currants, with a bitter mouthfeel.",E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate,82,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"Fairly tannic, this lovely Pinot Noir has a dusty, dry astringency that tamps down the palate's enjoyment of the fruit, and suggests aging. Yet the vast flavors range from cherries, pomegranates and persimmons to the cola and Asian spices that always characterize WS Pinots. Best after 2010 and for six years or so.",Bucher Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"When Russian River Zinfandel succeeds, and this one does, it marries the variety's wild, feral personality to the valley's perfect terroir to produce distinctive wines. Ottimino's 2005 Von Weidlich is very tannic, but classic in presentation, showing blackberry, currant and intense black pepper aromas and flavors. Might tempt you to cellar it, but it's best over the next year for sheer exuberance.",Von Weidlich Vineyard,92,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"A captivating Pinot Noir, soft, lush and sensual. It seduces the palate with appealing raspberry, cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spice flavors that are so delicious. Equally likeable for the silky, easy texture. Drink now.",Clone 777,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,William Knuttel
US,"Awkward and rustic. Although it's entirely dry, it has a sweet, pastry-filling cherry taste, with an edge of raisins. And the texture is sharp and green.",,82,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Romililly
US,"RRV doesn't get much fruitier than this. It explodes with black and red cherry, red currant, cola, sweet date, smoky vanilla and dusty Asian spice flavors. Despite all that power, the wine is silky and elegant. Delicious now, and should hold and improve for a number of years.",Graham Family Vineyard,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"Fairly tannic and very dry, with ripe, jammy flavors of cherries and raspberries that taste like they were baked into a pie sprinkled with cocoa and cinnamon, and then drizzled with anisette liqueur. Should develop additional bottle complexity over the next six years.",Flax Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"With rich, decadently delicious raspberry and cherry pie filling flavors, this is an impressive young Pinot. It's so sweet in fruit and oak, yet entirely dry in the finish, and the silky texture and elaborate oak overlay are just perfect. Hard to predict its longterm future, but it will make for elaborate drinking over the next four years.",Lancel Creek Vineyard,92,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Thomas George
US,"This is a very rich, decadent Zin, with massive waves of crushed ripe blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice, bacon and pepper. It's quite high in alcohol, but it wears the heat well. Drink now–2011.",Boschetti Vineyard,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,JR Wine
US,"Feels hot and Porty in the mouth, although it's very dry, with bitter raisinskin and shriveled cherry flavors. The alcohol approaches 16%.",Reserve,81,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years.",Five Sisters,97,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Too oaky, with dominating caramel and smoke flavors, and also very sharp. There's a citrusy bite of acidity that detracts. Finally, the wine ends on an overripe, Porty note.",Windacre,80,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Merriam
US,"A little on the sharp, green and minty side, with tart acids framing cherry, black raspberry and smoky wood flavors. A good wine that could use more lushness and richness.",,85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
US,"Tastes a bit sharp and minty in the mouth, but you'll find some good new oaky vanilla and smoke flavors backing up pineapples, green apples and pears.",Director's Cut,85,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Siduri has a good track record with this vineyard. The ‘07 is not a longterm ager, but if you're looking for a complex Russian River Pinot for now and through 2011, this will please. Dry and silky and complex, it has fully ripened cherry, currant, cola, rose petal and spice flavors.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,91,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"This is a big, full-bodied Pinot, dark in color, fairly tannic and weighty. Completely dry, it's made in a more robust style than many another Russian River Pinot Noir. The cherry, currant, pomegranate and persimmon flavors have an edge of raisins that adds interest. Decant it, let it breathe and watch how it changes in the glass.",Coopersmith,92,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Tight and aloof now, showing brawny tannins that accentuate the dryness, and the oak has not yet been integrated. But this is clearly a very fine wine. It's bone dry and silky and classically structured, with a deep, impressive core of berries and cola, as well as earthy, foresty mushrooms and balsam. Needs time. Give it a good six years in the cellar.",Olivet Lane,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is a wonderfully rich, seductive Pinot Noir. It has the lushness and complexity you want in a fine California bottling, with a silky texture and crisp acidity. The flavors are very complex, ranging from raspberry and cherry tart, cola and exotic rosehip tea to sandalwood, finishing with a flourish of spice. Lots of new oak, but it's perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Tina Marie Vineyard,94,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
US,"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. A scour of minerals gives the wine a steely grounding, while brilliant acidity makes the finish ultraclean. Really beautiful, a top Russian River Chardonnay at a fair price for the quality. The vineyard is in the cool Green Valley.",Ruxtan Vineyard,94,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lost Canyon
US,"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style. It's flashy in complex tiers of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and cinnamon spice, yet is silky and dry. The fruit comes from Sonoma Coast, Green Valley and the Middle Reach. An impressive followup to the inaugural '07, and a bottling to watch.",Les Pommiers,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,EnRoute
US,"A wildly delicious Pinot Noir, offering flashy raspberry and cherry jam flavors. It's soft and silky, just like you want a nice Pinot to be. Drink now for its silky, youthful appeal.",,89,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Migration
US,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014.",Meredith Estate,97,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dense and intricately constructed, this Pinot Noir always is a big, rich fruity wine. The 2007 is perhaps emblematic of the vineyard, showing massive flavors of cherries, blueberries and wilder, foxier berries that have an exotic note. The tannins are thick, and the wine is entirely dry. Very fine, a chef's dream to pair with perfectly matched food. Fine now, with a few hours of decanting, and should develop through 2013, at least.",Klopp Ranch,94,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is a restaurant wine. It's really fancy, really good and really food-friendly. Although it's rich in fruit and oak, it possesses an underlying tension, with acidity and tannins all vying for center stage. You're always looking for the center of gravity. In other words, a wine of great complexity and interest. Now–2013.",Estate Grown,94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
US,"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak.",Lorenzo Vineyard,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"Super sweet, with vanilla honey, apricot preserves, tangerine tart and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Best of all is crisp, tart acidity, like a squeeze of lemon, that brightens and heightens the richness and makes it finish clean.",Oley Sweet,93,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
US,"Opulence, lushness and a silky, seductive texture are what you expect from Pinot Noir, and this one delivers them all. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with subtle, complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, red currants, licorice, bacon and peppery spices. Easy to drink from the get-go, and gets more interesting as it warms in the glass.",,93,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Of The Place
US,"Grown in the very cool central-southwestern part of the appellation, by Sebastopol, this Pinot features crisp, mouthwatering acidity. And, in this wonderfully long hangtime vintage, its flavors are extraordinarily rich and pure, brimming with cherries and raspberries. It shows layers of complexity, yet is too young, with the parts unintegrated. Give it 4–5 years in a cool cellar.",Jenkins Vineyard,93,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, although it's a bit brusque in acidity. Still, it's enormously rich and dry, with long-lasting flavors of raspberry tart and cherry-cinnamon granola. Give it a brief decant, and drink with rich, umami-inspired fare, like teriaki salmon or cured meats.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Tastes too oaky and extracted, making the sweet wood, butterscotch, pear jam, peach cobbler and pineapple custard flavors a little obvious. But it will satisfy fans of this style.",,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Davis Family
US,"A solid Chardonnay that will satisfy fans of the variety. It's a sleekly tart, streamlined wine, with vanilla oak and buttered toast influences acting on the pineapples and green apples. Finishes a little sweet, but crisp.",Reserve,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Frei Brothers
US,"Another in a string of fine Pinots from this producer. Shows real cool coastal influence in the brisk acidity, delicate structure and deep flavors of cherries and cola, which seem to have a long hangtime complexity. Very good, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.",,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"This wine is strong in acidity and green, mouthwatering gooseberry flavors. It's so dry, your palate seeks out whatever fruity relief it can find, which comes in the form of limes, green apples and a squirt of honey. Very clean and elegant.",Old Vines,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Colombard,Y Rousseau
US,"Drinkable now, but has the structure for the cellar. Grown in a Forestville vineyard from modern Dijon clones, it's very fruity, offering clean, pure flavors of cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. The cool climate contributes fresh, zesty acidity, but the tannins are considerable. Beautiful now with decanting, and should develop through 2013.",Tobias Glen,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"New oak dominates this young wine, with vanilla-accented buttered toast and smoky aromas. Underneath the wood are strong, complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, licorice, cola and Asian spices. With fine tannins and acidity, it seems to be a natural for the cellar. Hold until after 2011.",Flax Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Simi winemaker Steve Reeder has produced an utterly delicious wine with this barrel-fermented beauty, the best nonreserve Chard from the winery in nearly 10 years. It shows flamboyant, complex flavors of tropical fruits, green apples, pears, butterscotch and smoky vanilla, with crisp, clean Russian River acidity. This is a good price, and the wine should be easy to find, with nearly 20,000 cases produced.",,91,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Made entirely from the French Dijon clone 777, this is a very pure Pinot Noir that relies on flavor, rather than subtlely, for success. And there's no shortage of flavor. Cherries, raspberries, cola, vanilla, honey, smoky oak and spice flood the mouth, while the finish is dry and balanced. Good as it is, the challenge is to build in additional layers of depth and complexity.",The Farm Vineyards,91,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"So easy to like now for its ripe, pie-filling flavors of raspberries and cherries, cola, sweet rhubarb, cured meat, cinnamon and white pepper. Just delicious, and the texture is pure silk and satin. Hard to keep from drinking right away, but it should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",Baker Ridge Vineyard,91,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Thomas George
US,"A polished, supple Sauvignon Blanc in the California style of ripe, slightly sweet and candied. Shows clean, crisp flavors of lemongrass, pineapple Lifesavers and vanilla.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Longboard
US,"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",Coopersmith,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dramatic in depth and structure, a cool-climate Syrah that will benefit from some time in the cellar. Deeply saturated in color, bone dry and full bodied, it offers ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, with plenty of black pepper and sweet, chewy leather. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A bit on the sugary side, making it not truly dry, but adequate acidity provides balance to the very rich pineapple, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. Great with Vietnamese or Chinese fare.",,84,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hauck
US,"A pace off the 2005, this single-vineyard wine, from the Sebastopol area, shows enormously ripe, powerful flavors of cherries, blackberries, raspberries, cola and vanilla. Fortunately, acidity is quite high, giving all that rich flavor a crisp bite.",Hallberg Vineyard,90,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"A lovely Pinot for drinking now. The wine is softly tannic and silky in the mouth, with rich, complex flavors of raspberries and cherries, exotic dusty spices such as cloves and star anise, and sweet charred oak. First-rate, and worth the price.",,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Thomas George
US,"Not for the faint-hearted, this Zin is brawny and tannic, and high alcohol gives it a fierce burn. But it's fully dry, and has strong, deep flavors of dark forest berries, leather, tobacco and peppery spices. Now–2012.",Reserve,87,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"Soft, sweet and candied, this has flavors of raspberry, cherry, roasted almond, honey and spice—almost like a granola bar. High alcohol adds to the impression of sweetness.",Alegria Vineyards Heritage Vines,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Acorn
US,"Oak dominates this wine, withstrong notes of buttered toast, vanilla and sweet char. There's nothing wrong with those pleasant aromas and flavors, but the underlying wine, with its cherry and currant fruit, is overpowered by the wood.",,85,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Foppiano
US,"Here's a racy, chiseled Chardonnay, with a pleasant veneer of smoky, buttered toast from new oak that enriches the lime and peach fruit. Elegant rather than powerful, it's a food-friendly wine. Try with lobster risotto.",,88,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,The Federalist
US,"Halleck is establishing a solid track record with this wine for New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. The wine is bone dry and ultra-crisp, with racy flavors of gooseberries, green apples, tangy minerals and Asian spices.",Little Sister,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Halleck
US,"Tough, hard and dry, with thick tannins and a cut of acidity that obscure deep flavors of blackberries, black licorice and black pepper. This chewy wine could develop over the next 2–3 years, but right now, it's pretty unrelieved.",Reserve,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frei Brothers
US,"Fruity and approachable, this is a Pinot Noir to drink now for its wealth of raspberries, cherries and milk chocolate. It's a smooth, silky wine that's a little candy-sweet on the finish.",,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"A fruity Pinot Noir, with delicious flavors of raspberry tart, Cocoa Puffs and vanilla cream. Feels a little too soft and melted for the cellar, but it's a sophisticated, dry wine that will pair nicely with steak.",Tina Marie Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett

US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, lilting, refined and utterly delicious. Testarossa stumbled with the '04, but otherwise their track record is great, and the '06 is right up there with the marvelous '05 and '03. The wine's cherry, licorice and smoky oak flavors are captured in a rewarding texture of silk and satin.",Fritschen Vineyard,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa

Finishes in a swirl of creamy, buttery spices.",Heintz Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Here's a young, hedonistic Pinot that captures the essence of RRV from a perfect vintage. Although it's ripely forward in cherry, pomegranate, Dr. Pepper, red licorice and cinnamon spice flavors, it shows a structural sophistication that elevates the score. Beautiful now, and should improve over the next 6 years.",Longbow,93,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Winemaker Steve Goldfield brings the same deft touch he displays with Pinot Noir to this lush, elegant wine. It has the structure of a gentle Merlot, but with the wild cherry and raspberry, date nut cake, cocoa, pepper and clove flavors that make it so distinctive and savory. This is consistently one of the best Zins from the RRV.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A very pretty, polished Pinot Noir, sourced from the cooler, foggier southern part of the valley, near River Road.

Now–2013.",Ceremonial,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler

Drink now.",Estate Bottled,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"This bottling continues to impress after all these years with its complexity and sheer deliciousness. The '06 shows charred barrel fermentation notes of pungent, smoky wood, but there's a great heart of citrus, melon and pepper spice flavors that makes the wine rich and rewarding. It's made even better by zesty acidity and a bone-dry finish.",La Petite Etoile,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean

US,"This is a very fruity-rich Zinfandel. It pushes the envelope on power and almost goes over the top, but wisely stops short in favor of balance, with acids and tannins providing needed finishing structure. The flavors are big and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries, blackberries, plums and chocolate, not to mention huge spiciness. Perfect with short ribs of beef.",Papera Ranch Vineyard,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy
US,"This bottling has been remarkably consistent over the last several vintages. Always exotic in lemondrop-candy fruit that's been well-oaked, it has nuances of flower petals, white peaches, minerals and honey. The '06 may be a little softer than past vintages.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"It's so easy to get a big Zin wrong, especially in a hot vintage like 2004, but Taft Street does a good juggling act with this single-vineyard Zin, made from century-old vines. The wine flirts with excessive sweetness, but pulls back at the last second, so that the blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors are essentially dry. Rich, fine tannins and brisk acidity help to provide balance.",Centennial Vines,88,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Taft Street
US,"Veteran winemaker Richard Arrowood has turned to this well-known vineyard for this Rhône blend of Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne.

Crisp acidity adds valuable balance.",Saralee's Vineyard Côte de Lune Blanc,88,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Arrowood
US,"Coming on the heels of the magnificent 2005, the '06 is somewhat heavier and more direct, with a soft, full-bodied mouthfeel framing very ripe currant flavors that are somewhat meaty and raisined. Will grow rounder and more mellow in the cellar, but not much more complex.",Silver Pines Vineyard,88,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"An okay red wine. It's soft, dry and common in structure, with thin flavors of blackberries, spices and a touch of oak.",,83,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Adler Fels
US,"This is a blend of some of the winery's best vineyards. The '06 is quite a good wine, but showcases some of the limitations of the vintage. Structurally, it's fine, with a good acid-tannin balance, but it could be more concentrated. The cherry and currant flavors are a little unfocused.",Westside Road Neighbors,89,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a good Pinot Noir. While it's not an ager because it's made for immediate consumption, it does show an elegant structure. Crisp acidity provides balance to the cola, cherry, pomegranate, spice and smoky vanilla flavors.",,88,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mossback
US,"Shows the classic structure of a fine Russian River Pinot, and Merry Edwards' way of making everything elegant. Dry and crisp, the wine displays cherry pulp and skin, cola, anise and spice flavors, wrapped into ultra-refined, velvety tannins. Doesn't seem to have the fruity focus and concentration of recent vintages, though, so drink soon.",Olivet Lane,88,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dry and crisp, but too feline in strong green aromas and flavors. A little of that goes a long way. Modest lemon and lime fruit comes to the rescue, but too little, too late.",Reserve,82,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Too green and acidic to earn a higher score, although it's pleasantly dry and clean, and there are some savory citrus flavors. But they're dominated by tart leafy tobacco and feline notes.",Reserve,82,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Frei Brothers
US,"Aggressive now in acidity, this Chardonnay has powerful sour Lifesaver candy flavors of pineapples and stony minerals, with a potent kick from smoky oak. It tastes young and jammy. It's elegant, and changes interestingly as it warms in the glass.",Ryo-fu,89,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"A gentle, easy to drink Pinot, with pleasantly complex flavors of raspberry and cherry pie filling and new oak. The alcohol is high, making for a burn that might offend Pinot purists. But most fans will appreciate its sheer deliciousness. Drink now.",Windsor Oaks Vineyard,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",DaKine Vineyard,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.",Feeney Vineyard,89,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Rich and spicy, this lusty Zin shows how well the variety does in Russian River Valley. Aged in American oak, it's deep and long in cherry, cranberry, licorice, cola, cinnamon and paprika spice flavors. Best now, with rich meat dishes and hard cheeses.",,87,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto
US,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself. The vineyard, which is owned by the winery, is only 19 acres, planted to an array of newer and older clones. Best after 2013, if you can keep your hands off.",Litton Estate Vineyard,100,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Always one of Williams Selyem's top Pinot Noirs, the 2007 is a spectacular wine. The vines are the closest to the river in the famed Rochioli vineyard, and the resulting wine always has an elegant structure and fruity accessibility that make it drinkable at a younger age. Showing rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, bacon, anise, Asian spices and smoky oak, it will develop beautifully over the next decade.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,97,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",Allen Vineyard,97,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale. Yet it's superbly balanced with acidity, giving a refreshing balance to the intense apricot jam, lemon drop, candied ginger, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. A tremendous success for a California dessert wine.",Late Harvest,96,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Muscat,Williams Selyem
US,"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Forward and delicious, a vibrant wine that's fully drinkable now for the richness of fruit. Shows ripe waves of black and red cherries, raspberries, cola, chocolate and crème brûlée, leading to a long, sweetly spicy finish. Seems destined to be an early drinker, so best now and through 2012.",Bucher Vineyard,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Pretty tannic, with a hard edge, although it's very fruity and rich, and should soften and mellow with time in the cellar. Thoroughly dry, it shows complex flavors of wild raspberries, cherry compote, cola and spices, compounded with smoky, sweet oak. Give it until 2011 to begin to come around.",Peay Vineyard,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Perhaps this wine could be drier, as the orange and apricot flavors seem to finish with a touch of sweetness. Still, it's clean and brisk in acidity. This should pair well with slightly sweet Asian fare.",Block Collection River Ranches,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
US,"Stainless- steel fermented, this Chard comes from a very cool part of Russian River Valley. You can taste that in the crisp acids that frame the green apple, pineapple, pear, lime and mineral flavors.",Teresa's,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Balletto
US,"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years.",Papera Vineyard,94,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"If there's any oak on this wine, it doesn't show. What does show up is crisply clean acidity and brilliantly ripe pineapple, lime and honeysuckle flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. It's a lovely cocktail sipper, and nice with bruschetta and olive or mushroom tapenade.",,88,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Angeline
US,"A good wine that provides real Russian River Chardonnay character, at a decent price. Dry and crisp, it's made full Burgundy style, with vanilla and smoke accents to the pear, green apple and tropical fruit flavors.",,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Taft Street
US,"Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla crème brûlée, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.",Ritchie Vineyard,94,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"Despite firm tannins and tough acidity this wine is so rich and silky, you can drink it now, with decanting. It floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, chocolate, anise, cinnamon spice and sweet oak. Absolutely delicious, with a silky, seductive mouthfeel. Although it's the least expensive of Williams Selyem's new releases, it's right up there.",Flax Vineyard,94,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A big, boldly powerful but elegant Zinfandel, full-bodied in the mouth and dry, offering waves of ripe fruits and spices. The cool 2007 vintage has kept the wine from being too ripe, resulting in balanced flavors of blackberries, currants, licorice, bacon, cocoa, black pepper and Asian spices. Just terrific. Drink over the next six years.",Forchini Vineyard,93,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This instantly delicious wine shows classic Russian River structure of firm tannins and brisk acidity, with a light, silky mouthfeel framing flavors of ripe raspberry, cherry, vanilla, mint, roasted almond and sweet oak. Drink it within the next five years for maximum enjoyment.",Karmen Isabella Dutton Ranch,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Superripe, almost sweet, this has good acidity and firm, fuzzy tannins that help balance the jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Good with a slightly sweet barbecue sauce on ribs and chicken.",Crow Ridge Vineyard,86,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,V. Sattui
US,"This Rhône blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots.",Marsanne-Roussanne-Viognier,85,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Kindred
US,"There's a lot of crunchy acidity and stony minerality in this Chablis-style Chardonnay. It's got plenty of fruit along the lines of green apples, limes, melons and dates, and is interesting for its sleek architecture.",1470 Estate,88,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Foppoli
US,"Made in a leaner, crisper style than many Chards nowadays, this Chardonnay trades power for elegance. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrusy acids framing flavors of limes, pineapples and green apples that have a minerally edge. New French oak adds just the right touch of richness.",Calcaire,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"Right out of the bottle, this wine is closed, but after a little while, notes of mushroom and balsam emerge. In the mouth, the wine features deep pomegranate and persimmon, those earthy red fruits so characteristic of a cool climate Pinot Noir. The structure is very good, with firm tannins and brisk acidity. Give this youthful wine 2–3 years in the bottle.",Jewell Block Vineyard Dutton Ranch,92,53,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Pretty oaky, with buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors upfront, but the pear, peach and pineapple fruit is strong, and so is the acidity, so that the oak is in keeping with everything else.",Fiorella,88,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Jordan's Chardonnay was made full-Burgundian style, barrel-fermented in nearly half new oak and aged on the lees. Partial malolactic fermentation has enabled brisk, appley acidity to remain. The flavors are of green apples and nectarines, with a mineral tug. This is an elegant, sophisticated Chardonnay.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jordan
US,"One-third new French oak adds a roasted, smoky vanilla overlay to the rich fruit. The underlying wine brims with ornate flavors of cherries, raspberries and blackberries that have been baked into a pie. A sleek finish of anise and cola adds interest. Drink now through 2009.",,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longboard
US,"A little one-dimensional, this soft Pinot has forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, vanilla, mint and smoke. It's an easy wine to like, with a silky texture and clean, spicy finish.",,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"A little too sweet and candied for true greatness, this Pinot, from the Sebastopol area in the southwest Russian River Valley, has LifeSaver flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola and vanilla.",Three Sons Cuvée,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"Super-rich in vanilla and smoky caramelized oak, and ripe in pineapples, peaches and apples, this is a powerful Chardonnay. It's dramatic now in sheer strength, but not an ager, so drink now.",Dutton Palms Vineyard,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"Another massive, dramatically rich Chardonnay from Williams Selyem. Purists will find it ponderous, but there's no denying the wealth of pineapple tart, orange custard, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. Lobster comes to mind as a natural partner.",Drake Estate Vineyard,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A very ripe, oaky Chardonnay made in a popular style to appeal to fans of richness. Swamps the palate with pineapple tart, pear marmalade, crème brûlée, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, balanced with crisp acidity.",Dutton Ranch Kyndall's Reserve,92,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"This is the driest, most elegant and balanced of Ottomino's new single-vineyard Zinfandels. It has a Cabernet-like structure, although the wild blackberry, mulberry, plum and exotic spice flavors are all Zin, as are the dense, sandpapery tannins. Good now with upscale rich beef and cheese dishes, and should develop gradually in the bottle for many years.",Von Weidlich Vineyard,92,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"This tastes ripe, fruity and forward, with notes of raspberry jam, vanilla bean, flat Dr. Pepper, baking pie spice and smoky sandalwood. Extravagant and opulent, it's a lovely Pinot Noir to drink now, though its delicate balance of tannin, acid and alcohol should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",Manzana Vineyard Dutton Ranch,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Tart acidity marks this wine, giving it a tingly palate feeling. But that could go away by summer 2010, when the wine will be fully available. Otherwise, it's silky and very good, with ripe black cherry, currant, cola, orange zest and sandalwood flavors. Now–2013.",,88,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
US,"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish.",,85,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bearboat
US,"A little soft and candied in its oaky pineapple, applesauce and buttered-popcorn flavors, but easy to drink. Chardonnay admirers will recognize a distinctively Californian interpretation of the variety.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lake Sonoma
US,"Very dry, tart and silky, this is a great Williams Selyem Pinot to drink now. It shows the classic elegance of the appellation, with nuanced flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, cloves, anise and pepper.",,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This Syrah remains tough and gritty in tannins, with a lockdown astringency that gets in between the cherry, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors and your enjoyment of them. It's very dry and crisp in acidity, and seems to have the inherent balance to mellow with 4–6 years in the cellar. Give it a try.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,88,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is a big, strong, gutsy Syrah, a powerhouse of jammy blackberries, currants, bacon, pepper and sandalwood. It's completely dry, with rich, thick tannins and a long, spicy finish. Good now, with proper fare, and should glidepath through the next six years.",Guyzer Block,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Davis Family
US,"A beautiful, fine young Pinot Noir that shows off the WesMar style of crisp elegance at a lower price than their single-vineyard wines. Dry and silky, it feels fine in the mouth, offering rich flavors of cherries, cola and sweet, smoky oak. Now–2012.",,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"This is a simple but delicious Pinot Noir. It has candied cherry flavors that are sweet and sour, with lots of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. Drink up.",,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma-Loeb
US,"There's lots of exotic Viognier character packed into this fruity, slightly sweet wine. It's powerful in peach and pineapple flavors that are so ripe, they taste like melted jelly, with a hit of alcohol.",Marsha's Vineyard,84,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Parkmon
US,"A little rough in texture and sweet on the finish, this pineappley brut is okay for everyday purposes, but the residual sugar is really too high for balance, especially at this price.",Cuvée 20 Brut,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Here's an elegant, crisp Chardonnay marked by the smoke and wood tannins of oak. The underlying wine has flavors of green apples and nectarines. It's bone dry and sleek, a wine made to accompany food, not overwhelm it.",Dutton Ranch,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"The vineyard is old, planted when Theodore Roosevelt was president, and the wine has very complicated flavors of wild fruits, dried herbs and peppery spices, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco and minerals. It's also very dry, although that comes at the cost of high alcohol. It's a really nice, smooth Zinfandel, although the flavors could be a bit more concentrated.",Baldacci Ranch Old Vine,87,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,D'Argenzio
US,"Dry and silky, a very proper Pinot Noir from this fine, cool vintage. It's marked in youth by brisk acids and forward, somewhat one-dimensional flavors of cherries, cola and spices, with the smoky sandalwood of barrel age. Could develop all kinds of surprises over the next 4–6 years.",Salzgeber Vineyard,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"Crisp and on the sweet side, this PG has flavors of honey, lemons, limes, green apples, figs and peppery spices. Nice as a cocktail sipper. Try with Chinese food for something different.",,85,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Balletto
US,"Lusty and potent, this has a wild quality to it. The flavors are of red and black berries, some freshly picked, some dried and overripe, with hints of pepper and anise. The brawny, briary, brambly quality expresses Sonoma County's old-vine Zin in all its glory.",Belloni,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"There's too much oak for too little fruit in this wine, with the result that it tastes of sappy, smoky toothpicks. Buried under all that wood are modest apricot and pineapple flavors.",Special Reserve,83,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Herzog
US,"A bit heavy on the oak, with vanilla, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. But the pineapple and apple fruit is nice and ripe, and the finish is rich in spicy honey.",,87,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,In Re
US,"Tannic and acidic now, with a bite-down mouthfeel, although the overall texture is nice and silky, and shows the elegance of Pinot Noir. Give it a few years in the cellar to let the black cherry, currant, anise and cedar flavors mellow and develop.",Oehlman Vineyard,90,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"Made in the ripely fruity, jammy, oaky style, this wine is almost over the top in pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie, vanilla cream, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that approach popcorn. It will appeal to those who like these huge, powerful Chardonnays.",,87,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ministry of the Vinterior
US,"Somewhat simple and fruity-sweet, this is a silky, crisp wine, plump with jammy cherry, raspberry, root beer and smoky vanilla flavors. Drink now.",,84,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"Dry and tart in sour cherry candy and cola flavors, this Pinot has hints of mint and tobacco that suggest the grapes weren't completely ripe. Drink now.",,85,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stomping Girl
US,"A wildly flavored, tannic and exuberant Zinfandel that showcases the variety's exotic personality. Dry and full-bodied, it has brambly flavors of blackberries, black currants, licorice, mocha and smoky cedar, liberally sprinkled with dusty Asian spices. Drink now–2013.",Rancho Bello Vineyard,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"There's a flowery note to this Chardonnay, which is dry, crisply acidic and strong in flavor in its youth. Brims with pineapple tart filling, Key lime pie, orange zest, honeysuckle, daffodil and smoky, vanilla-oak flavors, with a creamy, yeasty richness. Would benefit from greater restraint and subtlety, which may come after 3–5 years in the bottle. If you drink it now, give it a good decanting.",La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard,90,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"This tastes a little vegetal, but it's dry, crisp and creamy, with decent orange and peach flavors.",Suzanne's Blend,85,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gracianna
US,"The wine comes from a vineyard in the Green Valley. It's dry and balanced, with high acidity that gives the cherry and cola flavors a peppery briskness. Seems at its best now.",Widdoes,87,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"This nice drinking Chard offers plenty of bang for the buck. It's dry and creamy, with oak-infused pear, peach and green apple fruit flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices.",Lot 59,86,13,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
US,"Tastes a bit old and tired for a Zin that's less than 4 years of age, but on the plus side is the light, silky texture and complex flavors of dried berries and red currants, cola, cocoa, anise and black peppercorn.",Tom Feeney Ranch Old Vine,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,D'Argenzio
US,"This is a big, powerful Zinfandel. It's very strong in blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and peppery spice flavors, and also very tannic and dry. A dramatic wine, it will do well with barbecue and heavily spiced beef dishes. Should develop bottle age through 2013 or so.",Ottomino Vineyard,89,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"A bit too tannic and acidic, with a hard edge that interferes with the palate's enjoyment of the pure, refined raspberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. A good, distinguished Pinot, but lacks voluptuousness due to the coarseness. Drink now.",,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"Kind of expensive, but a very nice wine, dry, crisp and rich. It has savory flavors of pineapples, limes and other acidic citrus fruits, with vanilla and spice complications.",,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Grigio,Terlato
US,"A very good Sauvignon Blanc, crisp in cool-climate acidity and clean in the mouth, with a scour of minerals. It's also very fruity, showing flashy flavors of tangerines, pineapples and peaches. Delicious as a cocktail sipper.",,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Fritz
US,"The vineyard is in Green Valley, the coolest part of the appellation. You'll find very high acidity and an austere, elegant wine in this extremely low-yield Pinot Noir. The flavors are right on the edge, balancing less ripe peppermint and tannic Chinese-tea notes with richer cherries and raspberries. This is really a thrilling young wine, and while it may hold for years, it's best now for its tense youth.",Tina Marie Vineyard,93,43,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Anthill
US,"This is one of the most successful Pinots the winery has produced, and I have no doubt it's because the vintage was so cool. The wine is absolutely dry and has bracing acidity, with extraordinarily long, deep flavors of grapes that achieved maximum ripeness but remain balanced. Cherries, raspberries and blackberries flood the palate, enriched with earthier notes of balsam, cola, soy, licorice and spice. Drink now through 2011.",Chenoweth Ranch,93,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"A bit sharp, with the acidity giving a cutting mouthfeel to the cherry, cola, orange zest, anise and smoky sandalwood flavors. Yet it's nice and dry and silky, and two or three years in the bottle could provide resolution.",Windsor Oaks Vineyard,88,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"This shows the combo of a cool vintage and deft winemaking. It's impressively deep in citrus, fig and pepper flavors, with just a touch of oak that adds a nice, smoky edge. With high acidity, it really gets those tastebuds whistling. Best of all, the wine achieves the Holy Grail: low alcohol, only 13%, and bone dryness.",O.F.S.,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,De Loach
US,"An interesting and complex Chard marked by intense minerality. Calls to mind Chablis in the acidity, dryness and racy taste of cold steel. Also in the flavor mix are tart green apples, pineapples, limes, cinnamon spice and creamy lees.",Laguna Vineyard,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,"Deliciously drinkable now, this has soft, pliant tannins and a melting mouthfeel framing complex flavors of black cherry and raspberry, grilled Canadian bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. It's thoroughly dry, and its gamy quality makes it an especially good companion for lamb dishes.",My Father's Vineyard - Dutton Ranch,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton Estate
US,"Good raspberry, cherry, orange tea, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors in this wine, brightened with crisp acidity and wrapped into a silky texture. Seems a bit simple and direct though. Probably best in the next few years. From Hop Kiln.",,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,HKG
US,"Tastes sharp and jammy, a very young wine with fresh flavors of cherries and black raspberries. Gets the Pinot job done at a decent price, and could mellow in the bottle through 2011.",Estate Vineyards,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rodney Strong
US,"Delicious and complex now, offering upfront waves of raspberry tart, cherry pie with the crust, vanilla, toast, cinnamon and cocoa flavors. The acidity is just fine. A bit keen and juvenile, but could develop bottle nuance in a year or two.",,88,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Segue
US,"There's nothing subtle about this blush wine made from Zinfandel. It was barrel fermented and barrel aged for 15 months, giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel and even some dusty tannins, and it has robust flavors of cherries, cola, beef jerky and licorice. But it's dry and crisp and is something different.",D'Loiodice Zinfandel Rosá,85,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,D'Argenzio
US,"The richness of this bottling seems to have been falling over the last few vintages. The '06 is very dry and tart, with modest cherry, rhubarb, cola and spice flavors that are unlikely to evolve.",Dutton Ranch,85,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Simple, sweet and sour, with apricot and orange marmalade flavors. A blend of Merlot, Carignan, Syrah, Cab and Petite Sirah.",Betsy's Backacher,81,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Spann Vineyards
US,"Too sweet by far, with a white sugary finish to the pineapple and pear flavors. Crisp acidity helps to provide a framework of balance, but the sweetness really feeds into the perception that California white wines have residual sugar.",,80,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Arger-Martucci
US,"A big, bold, bright and spicy Chardonnay. You'll hardly miss the presence of oak, it's so rich in fruit. Floods the mouth with oranges, pineapples, lemons, limes and minerals, with crisp acidity.",Unoaked,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"If you like tart, less-than-ripe Sauvignon Blanc, you'll enjoy this one. It's acidic, but relieved by lemon, lime and honey flavors.",,84,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
US,"Fruity and oaky, this Chardonnay is made in the modern California style of immediate palate appeal. It's not especially complex or ageworthy, but has crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple tart, crème brûlée and vanilla cookies.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Athair
US,"Crisp and citrusy. Treads predictable grounds for California Sauvignon Blanc, but in a superior way. Flatters with pineapple and Meyer lemon flavors that are ultraclean and racy.",,86,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"New oak dominates the aromas and flavors, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel overwhelming the underlying fruit, which suggests pineapples and green apples. Although the wine is dry and acidity is fine, the fruit lacks the richness to support the oak.",Reserve,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"An easy, everyday Pinot that does a good job in the under-$20 category of introducing consumers to the pleasures of the variety. Dry and silky, it has cherry, herb tea and pepper flavors, and is gentle and easy in the mouth.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pedroncelli
US,"This Pinot is very rich in flavor, maybe too much so. It features a blast of jammy raspberry and cherry, with heavy cola syrup and smoky, oaky vanilla. Though certainly delicious and refined, it is a bit one-dimensional. Drink it soon.",Thomas Road Vineyard - Dutton Ranch,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"The fragrances of lemon blossoms and honeysuckle hit your nose as soon as you pop the cork on this seductive white wine. It's so flavorful, so long in fruit and exotic in spices, and finishes mercifully dry. Twenty percent of barrel fermentation adds the perfect touch of creaminess.",,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Grigio,Terlato
US,"Not only extremely drinkable, but shows real varietal elegance and class. Dry and fairly tannic, the wine brims with flavors of blackberries, blueberries, chocolate, sweet leather and Provençal herbs, with good acidity for balance. Best now.",Reserve,89,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frei Brothers
US,"Oak is the star of this Chard, to judge by the butterscotch and spicy caramel flavors that take center stage. Somewhere in there is a dessert-like pear compote, but the oak, or maybe it's the char level, really does seem too strong.",Emelia's Cuvée,84,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"The grapes are from the Green Valley. The 2006 vintage was very cool, and this wine doesn't seem entirely ripe. There's a green, mint and stem taste to the cherry fruit, and the tannins are astringent. But the oak regimen is beautiful, and a lamb chop will not be a bad pairing.",Dutton Ranch,84,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Despite the great vintage and the great location of the vineyard, this Pinot is dominated by baked cherry fruit and pepper flavors, making it feel hot and awkward. It's very dry, and has a silky texture, but the prickliness is a problem.",Thorn Road Ranch,84,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,D'Argenzio
US,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",Dutton Ranch Kylie's Cuvée,93,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"This is a very sweet, unctuous dessert wine, with the flavor and texture of honey. Made from Viognier, it has decadent apricot, peach, tangerine and crème brûlée notes that combine in a dense, delicious mélange.",Oley Dessert Wine,93,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
US,"With a rich spiciness and flavors of wild berry and currant, this is an excellent example of Sonoma County Zinfandel. It's robust and potent in alcohol, showing the variety's rustic nature at its best. It will partner well with stews and barbecue.",Lancel Creek Vineyard,89,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ulises Valdez
US,"Sparkling wine from Williams Selyem? Yes, in tiny quantities, in this case only 100 cases. The wine is dry and rich in lime, raspberry, mineral and yeast flavors, but a little rough, lacking the finesse you want in a fine bubbly.",Drake Estate Vineyard Blanc de Noir,86,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Williams Selyem
US,"Captures the essence of Russian River Chard with its crisp acids that boost and brighten an explosion of taste. The tropical fruit and spice flavors are enriched by toasty oak, while sur lie aging adds a creaminess to the texture of this deliciously dry wine.",,89,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"This is a wine that's so young and high in acidity, and so minty green, it's hard to find much to praise. A little oak would have helped fatten it, but the wine is unoaked.",Estate Reserve No Oak,83,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Foppoli
US,"This is a soft, simple wine. It shows good Gewürztraminer character in its spiciness, but it's mild in flavor, with a sweet finish.",Estate Bottled,82,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Balletto
US,"A bit raw and scoury in the mouth, with some green, minty sharpness to the cherry, spice and smoky oak flavors. The palate wants to like this wine, but that sharpness keeps on intruding on the pleasure.",Maboroshi Vineyard,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutcher Crossing
US,"Strong wood flavors characterize ths wine, minimizing its elegance and complexity. It's heavy in toasty oak, with a coating of smoky, charred caramel covering the underlying pear and apple fruit flavors.",,83,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hawley
US,"Dry and tannic, this Pinot has baked cherry and blackberry flavors, with a harsh, peppery edge. Tastes like the grapes got really cooked under the heat waves of this blazing vintage.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,82,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"Polished and sophisticated, with lush green apple, pineapple, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors. Likeable for its balance and sheer drinkability.",Reserve,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Frei Brothers
US,"There's lots of acidity in this young wine, which gives it a slightly minty, prickly feeling that actually adds to its food-friendliness. With pineapple, green apple, spice and smoky oak flavors, it finishes thoroughly dry. Easy to find, with 30,000 case production.",,88,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Green, unripe vegetal flavors mark this Pinot Noir. It does have some decent raspberry and cherry flavors, but turns sour on the finish.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,81,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gracianna
US,"Beautiful now, with a lovely texture and delicious flavors, this could even benefit from a couple years in the cellar. The vineyard is very fine, and Lost Canyon has a good track record with it. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries, licorice, cola and spice are ever shifting, making you want to try a second, third, fourth sip. Best now–2009, before it loses vitality.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"This trattoria-style wine shows plenty of easy charm. It's light bodied and pleasantly tart, with flavors of sour cherry candy, cola and spice, and a dry, clean finish. It's perfect for pasta dishes with red sauce and pizza, but avoid rich stews that will overwhelm it.",,88,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy
US,"A little one-dimensional, but otherwise a nice, everyday Pinot Noir with good varietal character. With a silky texture, it has dry, clean flavors of cherries, cola, spices and oak.",Goldie's Vines,85,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Toad Hollow
US,"A spectacular Chardonnay—this is dazzingly beautiful and mesmerizing in its appeal. The complexity of flavor stuns, offering tiers of pineapples, oranges, green apples and golden mangoes. Then the oaky influences appear in the form of buttered toast and caramel, with a suggestion of honey. The finish is dry and crisp in acidity.",South River Vineyard,97,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"Cherries, black raspberries, red currants and licorice formulate the heart of this generous wine. It's silky in tannins, with an easy mouthfeel that makes it drinkable now, and also has brisk, arching acidity. With smoky, oaky sweetness, it's delicious now.",Meredith Estate Méthode a l'Ancienne,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"You'll want to give a few months in the cellar to this Pinot. It's dark and ripe, and shows the supple, silky tannins Pinot is known for. The flavors are enormously complex. They range from black and red cherries and cola to currants and blueberries, with notes of tangerine rind, licorice and dusty Asian spices. Best from the winter of 2008 and for another five years.",Tobias Glen Méthode a l'Ancienne,93,51,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality. Give it until mid-2008, and for a couple years after.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Dry, creamy and crisp in acidity, this has rich pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors. It's easy to drink and enjoy.",,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray

US,"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure.",Floral Clone,87,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Godwin
US,"This is Rochioli's estate Pinot—without a vineyard designation. It's a fabulous wine, showing the winery's signature power, complexity and balance. The flavors are rich, with notes of red berries, persimmons, red currants, bacon and cola. Absolutely delicious now, and it should gain traction and change interestingly over 6–8 years.",,95,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"One word describes this Chardonnay: fabulous. It's really everything a California Chardonnay can deliver. Ripe tropical fruit, pear, green apple and honey flavors are wrapped into buttery, smoky oak. The richness is brightened by crisp acidity and a touch of minerals, showing its pedigree with every nuance. Drink soon, to enjoy its youthful beauty.",Sweetwater Vineyard,95,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"You have to consider the vintage to understand this Pinot, which comes from prime, southern valley terroir. It was very hot, the earliest harvest ever, and it was difficult for vintners to achieve total balance. The '04 Ted's Vineyard is certainly forward in cherries, cola, spice and chocolate, and it has a nice, silky mouthfeel. But it lacks the acidic crispness that makes for balance. Drink now.",Ted's Vineyard,87,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman
US,"A brilliant Chardonnay. It's powerful and ripe in fruit, offering a blast of pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and Meyer lemon tart flavors, accented with the buttered toast of oak. As intense as the fruit is, it's balanced by keen acidity and a stony minerality. Defines the elegant, opulent Russian River style.",Rachael's Vineyard,94,72,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"Shows the characteristics of young vines, a jammy, forward fruitiness, offering a wealth of black cherry, blueberry, currant and raspberry flavors that are wrapped into fine tannins and brightened with crisp acids. This is a vineyard to watch as the vines achieve age.",Coopersmith Méthode a l'Ancienne,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"There's plenty of cool-climate character in this vital, young Syrah. It's rich in flavors of freshly crushed black pepper, blackberry jam and bacon, with a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. It's a little light in texture, so drink it now with steak.",Estate Bottled,88,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Balletto
US,"Good, but a little lacking in depth and richness. The cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors are compromised by thinner notes of wintergreen and even a veggie touch.",,85,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"A tasty, simple and rather sweet wine. It has fruit juice flavors of pineapples, mangoes, apricots and peaches.",The Angel's Fare Saralee's Vineyard,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Lionheart
US,"Somewhat simple and oaky, this Chard has green apple, pineapple cookie, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. It's a pretty wine made for drinking now.",Estate Grown,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanna
US,"Tough going now with this very dry, young Syrah. Acidity and tannins star, making the wine astringent and burying the fruit. Yes, there's a deep core of black currants and blueberries, but it's a question whether aging will allow them to emerge.",Windsor Oaks Vineyard,87,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Anthill
US,"Nickel & Nickel brings its deft touch for Napa Valley Bordeaux varieties to Russian River Syrah, with compelling results. The wine is extraordinarily rich and refined, carrying waves of blackberry, cherry, dark chocolate, bacon, smoky cedar and spice flavors. The texture is gloriously fine in tannins. A really superior Syrah that should provide pleasure over the next four years.",Darien Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Nickel & Nickel
US,"The options for fine, really dry California Gewürz are surprisingly limited, which is too bad, because a good one, like Halleck's '06, is hard to beat. Racy and crisp in acidity, it's bright in flavor, offering waves of peaches, apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, figs, vanilla and the complex Asian spices from which the variety takes its name.",Piner Creek Ranch Dry,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Halleck
US,"There's a streak of green mint that cuts through the cherry and cola flavors, leaving behind a sharp hit of acid. Doesn't seem likely to develop with age, but good for its dry silkiness.",,85,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Derbes
US,"Not a great success. It's sweet, but not enough to be satisfying given the flavors— citrus fruits edged with unripe vegetal.",Late Harvest,84,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Merry Edwards
US,"Proper rather than exciting, this Chard was made classic style, with 100% barrel fermentation, 100% malolactic fermentation and plenty of lees. It's creamy and smooth, with modest flavors of peaches, pineapples and green apples.",,86,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Terlato
US,"The vineyard is on Frei Road, which is in the cooler, southern part of the appellation, and this wine shows how well a good vintage can ripen the grapes into tropical fruit directions while still maintaining vibrant acidity. But the oak drowns the terroir in caramelly, butterscotchy sweetness.",Zio Tony Ranch,86,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"Good, but overly soft and simple, with a taste of melted cherry pie, cola and licorice. Needs greater structure and liveliness.",Rod's Pride,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Toad Hollow

US,"Comes down on the lean, hard, Chablis-like side of Chardonnay, with a steely spine of minerals and tangy acidity. This provides an elegant infrastructure to the subtle pineapple, green apple and lime zest flavors.",Porter Bass Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Patz & Hall has captured the cool-climate essence of southern Sonoma Chard with this dry, crisply acidic, and vibrantly fruity young wine.

US,"There are Russian River Pinot Noirs that are dark, heavy and dense, and then there are bottlings like this. It's a silky, light-hearted wine, easy and gentle in the mouth.

Drink now.",Maboroshi Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach

US,"Straddles the line between dry and off-dry, and veers into the latter. Shows sweet flavors of citrus fruits, vanilla and meringue, like a pastry. Good, but palls after a few sips.",,83,11,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Kenwood
US,"This Pinot tastes young and undeveloped, but it should go places. Evidence of its youth lies in the big tannins and acids and the way the fruit flavors are so fresh and primary. Although it's delicious in berries and currants, it just hasn't pulled together. It's so balanced it should benefit from 4–5 years in a cellar.",Floodgate Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
US,"Fine acidity and a lick of steel give this Sauvignon Blanc a gravity above and beyond the savory flavors of citrus, green apple, lemongrass and honey. With its elegance, this should pair well with roast chicken.",,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli

US,"A great success for this bottling. With extraordinarily high residual sugar, the wine is very sweet in wild honey, infused with the essence of oranges and apricots, folded into rich, buttery custard, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar and cinnamon. It's all balanced with a squirt of lime acid. If that sounds good, it is.

US,"This is great Zinfandel. The vineyard was planted in 1915 and probably contains other varieties than Zinfandel. Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice. Has the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with smooth tannins and fine acidity. Zinfandel hardly gets any better than this.",Crow Ridge Vineyard,95,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,V. Sattui

US,"Sometimes Pinot Blanc resembles Chardonnay, but this crisp, minerally, citrusy wine strikes a different pose. It does have a rich, creamy mouthfeel, which gives it a full-bodied mouthfeel, but it has a dry, steely character that makes it far friendlier with food than a fat, buttery Chard.",,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Trinitas

US,"This is one of the best rosés in California.

Interesting now, if a bit primary in fruit, and balanced enough to develop additional nuances over the next six years.",Mononi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"An extraordinarily lush, dramatic Pinot Noir. Dense and full-bodied, it shows flashy flavors of black and red berries, currants, cola, pomegranates and dusty spices, enhanced with the most perfect application of smoky oak and wrapped into a rich, silky texture. The balance is exquisite, a tension of acidity and tannins. Beautiful now, and should develop bottle complexity for at least six years.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,97,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Really balanced and elegant, with such bracing acidity. Shows pure flavors of cherries and cassis, with earthy, forest floor notes and a touch of cherry tomato and beetroot. Only moderately oaked, just enough to add a smoky edge. Very young and minerally now, this should hold and improve for five to eight years.",,91,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Emeritus
US,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",O'Neel Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards

US,"A tremendous, powerful, authoritative Chardonnay, among the elites of California. Just massive in pineapple-infused crème brûlée, pear custard, buttered toast, roasted hazelnut, and cinnamon spice flavors, offset by refreshing acidity and grounded with a floor of firm minerals.

US,"A massive Pinot Noir that showcases the magnificence of the vintage, as well as this proven vineyard. Shows youthful, tannin-inspired flavors of sour black and red cherries, plums, red currants, cola, anise and sandalwood, finished with pepper, cinnamon and other dusty spices.

New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"Rich and appealing, a new bottling from the winery. All the parts have yet to knit together, but they're all good, and the wine should drink well by winter 2007. New oak frames tart green apple, pineapple, kumquat and cinnamon spice flavors that are heightened by bright, zesty acidity.",Emelia's Cuvée,90,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano

It's simple and sweet, with cola and candied Lifesaver flavors.",Morelli Lane,83,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WillowBrook Cellars
US,"The vineyard is in Fulton, a cool part of the southeastern valley heavily influenced by fog, and the vines are about 100 years old. This is great, classic Zinfandel. It should be in a museum. Despite high alcohol, it has a silky, Pinot-esque suppleness, balanced with crisp acids, and is profoundly rich in Zinny flavor. Currants, mushu plum sauce, anise, crushed black pepper, dark chocolate and rich Asian spices last forever on the finish.",Highwire Vineyard,96,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hartford
US,"Made in the Merry Edwards style, which is powerfully ripe and extracted, yet always balanced. Dazzles with enormous cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, beef jerky, raspberry tart, anise, pepper and smoky cedar flavors that finish with amazing length. Yet the tannin-acid structure is superb, and the wine is totally dry. Beautiful now, and should age through 2012.",Klopp Ranch,96,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"The vineyard was made famous by Williams Selyem for fantastically rich, ageable Pinot Noirs. Now Merry Edwards has her own bottling, and it's right up there.

Needs time, and will develop complexities through 2012, at least.",Flax Vineyard,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"The winery's most expensive wine comes from very low-yielding Martini selection grapes planted in 1975. The '07, tasted at a bit more than one year of age, was pronounced in smoky oak and robust tannins, showing jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise, cloves and cedar. Hold this powerful wine until 2011.",Arrendell Vineyard,95,85,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"Super-rich, a fat, opulent Chard that tastes almost as sweet as a dessert, except it's dry.

Lush and gorgeous.",Allen Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.",Heintz Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A beautiful, polished Pinot Noir that offers loads of flavor, while preserving the vital acidity that keeps the wine fresh and balanced. Cherries, raspberries, root beer, vanilla, cinnamon and smoky sandalwood flood the mouth, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now through 2013.",Dutton Ranch,94,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Always a dense wine in youth, Keefer is an ager, and winemaker Ehren Jordan has captured its essence with this impressive young wine. Shows classic Russian River structure, with firm acids and a dusting of tannins that frame vibrant flavors of cherry, rhubarb, red currant, cola, pomegranate and cedar. Delicious and compelling, this wine will evolve for up to six years.",Keefer Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"An awesome Chardonnay. Explodes in the mouth with massive pineapple, crème brûlée, apricot jam and new oak flavors that finish thoroughly dry. For all the richness, there's a near-perfect balance of acidity, and a mineral undertow that grounds the wine, providing vitality and life. Brilliant now and through 2013.",Keefer Ranch,94,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"Here's a big, impressive Chardonnay. It's massive in new oak, offering waves of vanilla, buttered toast and caramelized flavors. Yet the underlying pineapple, pear and tropical fruit flavors are big enough to easily support that elaborate coating. Thoroughly delicious and compelling, a wine to drink now and through 2013.",Cresta Ridge Vineyard,94,41,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Just beautiful. Showcases true Russian River characteristics of dryness, acidity and, in this vintage, exceptional ripeness without too much alcohol. Silky and complex, with deep, long flavors of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates, leather, cocoa and peppery spices. A tremendously attractive wine that will age for a good six years.",Nicole's Vineyard,94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",Don Miguel Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"There's a decent wine here, crisp and ripe in pineapple flavor, but it's been buried under so much oak, it's practically invisible. The wine reeks of woodsap and charred barrels, dominated by a sweet vanilla taste.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,83,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Falcor
US,"This is a hot, sweet Zinfandel, with an alcohol level of 15.4%. It's very ripe and forward in jammy cherry-berry fruit, with a spicy edge of cola and mocha. It contains some Petite Sirah and Alicante, like an old-fashioned field blend.",Old Vine,83,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Fanucchi
US,"They don't tell us what the residual sugar is, but the wine sure tastes sweet. Hot and simple, too, with a flabby texture. Not very good despite the fruit, especially at this price.",Gilsson Vineyard,82,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Tin Barn
US,"This isn't one of those rich, gooey Chardonnays that dazzle some people. But it's a crisp, minerally wine that shows great elegance and Chablis-like sophistication. Dry and crisp, it shows complex flavors of tart green apples and pears, with subtle influences of smoky oak.",Estate Bottled,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"This is Merry Edwards' personal vineyard, and as the vines gain age, the wines get better and better. The 2006 is young and grapey and needs time in the cellar to come around. It's a powerhouse of a wine, stuffed with black and red cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors. Impresses for the sheer depth of flavor and overall balance. Best after 2010, if you can keep your hands off it.",Meredith Estate,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A blend of several vineyards located near the winery, in the valley's famed Middle Reach, this is the biggest and richest of Williams Selyem's Spring 2007 releases. Full-bodied and soft, it shows ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, plums, sweet rhubarb, cola and sandalwood. Beautiful now and through 2013.",Westside Road Neighbors,93,67,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Shows the plush ripeness of this vintage, offering a blast of cherry, raspberry, currant, mocha, licorice and smoky cedar flavors. Yet the balance is just fine, with crisp coastal acidity and richly textured tannins. Drink early for its youthful pleasures.",Bohemian Vineyard,93,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
US,"This is a seriously good Pinot. It's easy to imagine drinking it at a great restaurant, with a fabulous steak. The tannin-acid structure is just perfect, and the texture is silky. Yet tasted at the age 18 months, it's a bit heavy in jammy cherries and raspberries, which suggests aging. Try holding off until 2011–2015.",Toboni Vineyard,93,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. The texture is right down the middle between silky-light and full-bodied. Beautiful now and through 2012.",Salzgeber Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"The winery's Saralee's bottling has been variable over the years. The '06 is tasty and eminently drinkable if you want a nice, dry, crisp Pinot. It's pale in color, silky in the mouth, and direct in cherry, cola, spice and oaky flavors. Drink now.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Continues Martin Ray's track record with this bottling, an elegant, likable Pinot Noir that appeals for its silky texture and forward fruit. Cherry, currant, toasty oak, vanilla and white chocolate flavors end with a spicy, clean finish.",Reserve,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"Fans of big, soft, rich, high-alcohol Zins will rejoice with this epic bottling. The candied, pastry-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, plums, chocolate and red licorice are almost sweet, although the wine is probably dry, technically speaking.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,88,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,John Tyler
US,"Very rich and dramatic, a fine Pinot, and it's nice to see this veteran winery continue at such a high level. With a near-perfect structure of acidity and tannins, it offers lush flavors of cherries, raspberries, cotton candy, sweet vanilla, granola and cinnamon spices. Grows better and better in the glass.",Hallberg Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Brilliantly crisp and lushly creamy and honeyed, just a beautiful Chardonnay that offers decadence and sheer deliciousness. Massive in grilled pineapples, green apples, ripe nectarines and butterscotch, brightened with mouthwatering acidity. A joy to drink.",Russian River Selection,94,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Farrell's 2007 lineup of Chardonnays is a triumph, and this Starr Ridge is among their best. It's a big wine, rich in tropical fruit, peach, green apple, mineral and oak flavors that completely satisfy now. Yet there's an acidic urgency that suggests aging for up to six years, by which time the wine should achieve a honeyed creaminess.",Starr Ridge Vineyard,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Despite a silky, medium-bodied texture, this Pinot is tough and tannic, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. It's deep in flavor, with waves of cherry, cola, rhubarb, pomegranate, balsam, mushroom and sandalwood, and is elegantly structured and thoroughly dry. Needs time. Better after 2011.",Rochioli Vineyard,93,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"This is a very concentrated and intense young Sauvignon Blanc. With 43% new oak, it shows a rich creaminess riding over the laser-like gooseberry, grapefruit and lime flavors. It's also extremely crisp in acidity, since malolactic fermentation was entirely prevented.",La  Petite Etoile Vineyard,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Vineyard sources for the winery's reserve tier of Chardonnay have bounced around over the years. Now, it's Russian River, but this Chard is far from Ferrari-Carano's best. It has decent peach and apple fruit, but with a thin brittleness inappropriate for this price, and all that new oak doesn't really help.",Tre Terre,84,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Crispness and dryness mark this elegant young Pinot Noir. It feels silky, almost delicate in the mouth, but with powerful cherry, pomegranateand cola flavors. Should develop for up to six years in the bottle.",Longbow,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Despite some decent fruit, this Zin, from the Chiles Valley district is as dry and hot as a lit match, which makes the tannins feel really astringent.",Dalraddy Vineyard,82,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Tin Barn
US,"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Affaire de Coeur
US,"Here's a big, rich, full-bodied Zin that calls for equally big foods, like tri-tip, barbecued ribs and Szechuan-style beef. Although it's extremely dry, it's fruity, with flavors of blackberries, mulberries and plums, accented with spices, sassafras and grilled meat.",Feeney Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This Pinot Noir balances its extraordinary richness with a silky texture, crisp acidity and a dry, tangy minerality. The immediate impression is of fruit: cherries, raspberries and milk chocolate. Yet the finish is brisk and clean. Irresistably drinkable.",Third Alarm Reserve,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"Similar to the excellent 2005, this bottling needs some time in the cellar to let the fruit, tannins, acids and oak knit together. Tasted in early winter of 2009, it's fresh and dramatic, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, licorice, orange zest and cedar. Try toward 2010.",Tobias Glen,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A nice Russian River Chard, firm in acidic minerals, with an edge of dried herbs and wood char to the pineapple, green apple and cream caramel flavors.",Ritchie Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"A beautiful, soft and likeable Pinot Noir, with considerable complexity. Shows waves of black cherries, red currants, cola, mocha, bacon, licorice and sandalwood flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices. Dry and silky, this Pinot is drinking well now, and should hold over the next six years.",Quail Hill Vineyard,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"There's tons of cherry, cola and licorice flavor in this vigorous young Pinot. It also shows an earthy streak of herbs and mushrooms, suggesting a sautéed Portobello splashed with balsamic. The result is complex and fascinating, yet vigorous tannins and keen acidity warrant time in the cellar. Give it through 2011.",Olivet Lane,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Great Zin. It's robust and brawny, in the way of Zin, with the rustic wild berry, nettle, chamomile and spice flavors you expect from the variety, but shows good control in the smooth tannins and modulated alcohol. Picks up extra points for sheer deliciousness.",Eight Cousins Vineyard,89,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pellegrini
US,"A vigorous wine. In its youth it's bright and jammy in raspberries, cherries and currants, with fine, silky tannins and citrusy acidity, like a squeeze of lime. There's oak here, too. A bit disjointed now. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar to knit together.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,90,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman
US,"Weirdly medicinal, with cherry cough syrup flavors and a gooey texture. This is a huge disappointment. Tasted twice.",,81,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"This is ageable and enormously complex, and should do very interesting things over the next six years. Right now it is tight and fresh in primary fruits and acidity. It's an enormously rich wine, vast in black cherries, pomegranates, cola, red plums, balsam and sautéed mushroom flavors, with a gamy, forest-floor earthiness. Time in the bottle can only improve it through 2011.",Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard,96,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A very fine Chard, complex and layered, and quite dry. Acidity makes the tangerine, kumquat, ripe yellow pear, roasted pineapple and oaky, crème brûlée flavors really come alive. After you swallow, the wine leaves behind a delicious impression.",Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard,95,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A beautifully complex and sophisticated wine, showing lush flavors of red cherry pie filling, cranberry tart, Dr. Pepper and cedar. Finishes rich and butterscotchy, but thoroughly dry, with a crisp tang of citrusy acidity. Now through 2012.",,92,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A luscious Pinot Noir, dark and rich in blackberry, cherry, cola, cocoa, cedar and spice flavors. It's big and powerful now in fruit, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",Mononi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"The vineyard is in the warmest corner of the valley, almost into Dry Creek, and the wine in its youth is a bit heavy. But it's quite rich and complex, showing flavors of currants, mocha, espresso, oranges, cola and peppery spice. Nice now, with a good steak, and could easily develop over the next 8 years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Dry and balanced, this young wine has a steely mineral tang to the fruitier flavors of ripe yellow apricots, tangerines and baked green apples. Oak adds smoky, spicy wood notes. A very nice Chard at a good price.",Sonoma Reserve,87,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"It's a barrel selection from J's Russian River vineyards. New oak stands out, offering smoky, caramelly notes, but there's an enormous core of blackberries, cherries and raspberries that just wants some time to emerge. Give this dry, tight wine 3–4 years in the cellar.",Barrel 16,93,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Made from a block in the estate vineyard, the Chardonnay shows classic Green Valley acidity and savory flavors of Key lime pie, stony minerals, Asian pears and pineapple brûlée, with a rich coating of smoky oak. For all the opulence, it's totally dry on the finish. Complex and compelling. Drink now–2013 for freshness and vitality.",Bonita's Hill Don Miguel Vineyard,93,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level. Barrel fermented in 80% new oak, aged on the lees and put through full malolactic fermentation, it's rich, creamy, buttery and exotically flavored in opulent toasted barrel and tropical fruits. I personally like this style, but others might find it too oaky.",Winemaker's Reserve,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Château Souverain
US,"Another successful Pinot, similar to the '04— may be a bit crisper and more elegant, but with the same lovely cola, cherry, strawberry, root beer, dusty spice and vanilla-oak flavors. Probably offering its most exuberant side now and for a year or two.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pellegrini
US,"No winery has associated itself more with Petite Sirah than Foppiano. That understanding shows in this wine, which wrestles the variety's rustically wild nature into something resembling submission. Still, it retains its dry, tannic edge, with all sorts of forest berry and herb flavors. Will live for many years, gradually softening.",Estate,88,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Foppiano
US,"Although this isn't one of Arista's single-vineyard bottlings, it's right up there with them, offering rich flavors and a lovely structure. It's dry and silky, with brisk acidity backing raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors, and an earthy hint of balsam-splashed beefsteak tomato. Drink now–2013.",,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This is the kind of Chardonnay that divides wine lovers into enemy camps. Old World purists will criticize the candied richness. New World fans will love the toasted marshmallow, caramel corn and buttered toast flavors that rest on a solid foundation of pineapple and green apple fruit.",Reserve,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Buehler
US,"This is a small production barrel selection from the estate vineyard in Green Valley. It's very rich and quite young, too primary and tannic to drink now, but extraordinarily rich in the cherries, blackberries, blueberries and Asian spices that characterize the estate. Best 2008–2012.",Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard,95,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"They say the vines are 85 years old, and I can believe it, because these authentically old Zin vines are intense. It's not just intensity of cherry-berry fruit, but of substances that seem to exist deep in the soil, like stones and minerals and organic matter and decomposing volcanic litter and old compounds washed down from the mountains over time. I like this dry, tannic, complex Zinfandel a lot.",Old Vine Gaddis Vineyard,93,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hawley
US,"Made in a softly flamboyant style, with massive flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème brûlée, firmed with stony minerals. Tons of stuffing in this opulent Chardonnay, which was aged in 50% new oak.",Highlands Estates Piner Hills,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is quite a good Pinot Noir, and one to drink now for its silky deliciousness. It flatters the palate with ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper. Hard to imagine anyone not liking it a lot.",Coster Vineyard,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vision Cellars
US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.",Tré Terre,91,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"An interesting Pinot Noir marked by the acidity and primary fruit of extreme youth. Dry and silky, it shows vibrant flavors of cherries, rose tea, pomegranates, cola and smoky cedar, with 40% new oak. A bit aloof and tough, although extremely elegant. Could begin to develop bottle complexity after 2010.",Robert Thomas Vineyard,92,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Marked by fresh, sleek acidity and firm, dusty tannins, this is a Pinot to stash in the cellar for a while. It's just too tough and hard now. Give it 4–6 years to soften, and let the black cherries, red currants and cola mesh with the oak and transform with the magic of bottle age.",,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A dry, and elegant fruit-forward wine. It was harvested relatively early, at lower brix, resulting in crisp acidity and succulent flavors of tart green apples and kiwis, with a tang of pepper and cinnamon. Delicious.",Unoaked,88,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"Four things define this wine. Extraordinarily ripe fruit, high acidity, a terroir-driven minerality, and lots of new French oak. The flavors are of tropical fruits, the ripest white peaches and vanilla cream, baked into spicy pastry crust. The impression is of impossible richness, California Chardonnay at its most opulent, flamboyant limit.",Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard,95,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Good blackberry, cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors in this rich, dry wine, but it's also tight in tannins and brisk in acidity. Too hard and unsupple for drinking now. Give it 4–5 years to change in the bottle.",Toboni Vineyard,90,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",Heintz Vineyard,96,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",Allen Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a cool-climate wine made in a good vintage. It's very dry and rich in acidity and tannins, but well-ripened grapes have yielded deep flavors of blackberry jam, blueberries and pepper, with a savory edge of grilled meat. This balanced, powerful Syrah will evolve over the next six years.",Cherry Ridge Vineyard,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Quite pale for a Pinot Noir, and with a lilting, delicately silky mouthfeel. But there's nothing light about the flavors, which are intricate as a tapestry. The cherries, raspberries, orange peel and vanilla have an herbal edge of rosehip tea and rhubarb pie. Now through 2012.",,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance.",Keefer Ranch,85,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Novy
US,"Dry, silky and tannic, this Pinot shows forward cherry, red currant, cola and cinnamon-nutmeg flavors. It's a good example of a drink-me-now wine with some real complexity and class.",Reserve,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"This bottling, an extended lees Chardonnay, has been an innovation by the winery. The experiment is augmented by holding the release date back longer than usual. The 2006 vintage was not a great success, but this is an interesting, complex wine that should further develop in the bottle. Marked by the creamy, slightly sour taste of the lees, it has richness added by ripe apple and pineapple fruit and sweet, smoky oak.",Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"A glorious success, for this or any vintage. It shows classic Russian River balance and refinement, with exquisitely ripe berry and stone fruit flavors counterbalanced with earthier mushroom and funky leather notes. The acids, tannins and silky mouthfeel are textbook Pinot. Best now–2012.",Olivet Lane,94,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"An easy to drink Pinot for its dryness, exceptionally low alcohol, and cleansing acidity. It has cherry, red plum, cola and herb flavors, framed with sweet, smoky sandalwood. Decant for a while.",Sterling Family Vineyard,90,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Old World
US,"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences.",Unoaked,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, showing flamboyantly ripe cherry, raspberry and chocolate-cola fruit, spiced with cinnamon and anise and enhanced with smoky oak. Fortunately, all this richness is framed in a fine structure of acidity and tannins. Drink now through 2012.",Estate Grown,91,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
US,"Soft and gentle, yet firm in tannins, this Zin has an interesting dried herb and molasses edge to the blackberries, cherries and peppery spices. It's full-bodied, dry and complex, a wine to pair with beef dishes.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Very ripe and fruity-spicy, almost like a Zinfandel except for the silkiness, this Pinot shows flavors of black cherry pie filling, red currants and pomegranates, with earthier notes of cola and sweet tobacco. It's a bone dry wine whose thick tannins suggest modest ageability. Now through 2012.",Dutton Ranch,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Crisp and silky, this is a pretty Pinot Noir to drink now. It offers a wealth of cherry, cola, anise, sandalwood, cinnamon and pepper flavors that finish dry and complex.",,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Shows the power and extraction of this vineyard's other Pinot Noirs, a huge wine stuffed with dramatic flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants, cola and smoky new oak. Almost like a Cabernet, except for the silky tannins. Very delicious and complex, but awkward, and needs time. Better 2011–2014.",Stony Block Don Miguel Vineyard,92,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the acidity is very high, giving a bright purity to the kiwi, Key lime pie, pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors. Lots of toasty new French oak and lees bring super creaminess to the mouthfeel. White Burgundy is the model, expressed California-style.",Keefer Ranch,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Armida
US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",Fiorella,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",Tré Terre,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This beautiful Pinot Noir drinks well now because it's so fruity, delicately structured and crisp. Shows oak-inspired and refined raspberry, cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors that finish in a rich swirl of exotic spices. Has the inherent balance to develop through at least 2014.",The Whitewing Amber Ridge,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
US,"Very fine and complex. This deeply flavored Pinot Noir is powerful, but it's also elegantly silky, which is the magic combination. Shows perfectly ripe cherry and raspberry fruit, with gorgeous overtones of oak and spices. Beautiful now, and will age well through 2014 or so.",Nugent Vineyard,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir. Plays in the major leagues, with its refined texture and complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice and sandalwood, with a long, spicy finish. The most notable feature is the structure. Feels so lush and fine, so delectable, so dramatic. This is one of the best Pinots available for drinking now.",,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
US,"Feels a bit heavy now, with direct flavors, like cherry and chocolate cream pie filling without the crust. However, there are suggestions that aging will benefit. The tannins are thick, and the acidity is good enough to carry the wine through some evolution. Try after 2011.",Longbow,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This is a big, oaky, creamy Chardonnay, but it retains the crisp acidity and overall control to be balanced and even elegant despite its size. Shows potent flavors of pineapple-infused crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla custard. Drink now.",Winemaker's Reserve,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Souverain
US,"Bright and zesty, with flavors of limes, kiwi fruit, green apples and pineapples, accompanied by crisp acidity. Could almost be an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Oak plays only a supporting role.",,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jordan
US,"Vigorous and tannic, this young Pinot is hard right now. It also seems a little unbalanced, with some raisins and mint bracketing the cherries. Could just be going through an awkward youth. Try in 2011.",Graham Family Vineyard,87,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"Showing true cool-climate character, this Chard brims with tropical fruit, pear, honeysuckle and smoky oaky-vanilla flavors, with a gentle scour of acids. Pretty good price for a wine this rich.",The Reserve,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bennett Family
US,"Tastes of new oak and is also acidic, a combo that makes the mouthfeel rather harsh and salty, despite obviously well-ripened fruit. May settle down and show softer, lusher notes in a year or so.",Dominique,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Shows the balance and harmony of RRV Pinot, at a fair price. Dry and silky, bursting with cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate and cinnamon spice flavors that are enriched with sweet vanilla from oak barrels. Easy to find, with more than 17,000 cases produced.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"This is one of your bigger, fatter, riper Russian River Pinots, with jammy, oak-accented cherry, raspberry, root beer and vanilla flavors that are very forward and lush. The wine is extremely soft, though, and could certainly use a boost of acidity for balance. Still, it sure is tasty. Drink now.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonnet
US,"Jacaman's been doing a good job with their Russian River Pinot. This one's a bit off the pace of the '03, due to the hotter vintage that makes the wine riper and simpler. But it's still a flavorful, dry, silky wine, with a fair degree of complexity. Drink now.",,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
US,"Nice and ripe in black cherry pie filling, black raspberry, cola, root beer and smoky oak flavors, this Pinot has some firm tannins that will stand up to a rich steak. It should hold through 2010.",Castelli-Knight Ranch Vineyard,91,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armida
US,"The grapes seem like they were picked earlier than others, making for a lean-style Pinot Noir that's high in acids and minerality. It's almost austere, although maybe “restrained” is a better word. Dry and tannic, but with a deep core of cherry compote fruit, the wine needs a little time. Should begin to blossom by 2007 and drink well through 2012.",Hailey's Block,91,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
US,"If you're a fan of big, oaky Chards, you'll like this one. It's rich and unctuous in ripe tropical fruit custard flavors, with the buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky char that comes from new French barrels. But it has a perky acidity that lends it an appley, minerally note.",Floral Clone,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Godwin
US,"With a pretty salmon color, this is a dry and very rich bubbly. It has subtle strawberry, raspberry, lime and yeast flavors. Could be smoother and more refined in texture, but it's a polished wine to drink now, especially with sushi.",J Brut Rosé,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"An acidic, minerally Chardonnay  showing structure, cleanliness and elegance. Richness comes by way of intense limes, as well as the usual complexities of new oak and lees aging, and there is not the slightest suggestion of sweetness. This is a very pure, Zen-like expression of cool-climate California Chardonnay.",Don Miguel Vineyard,91,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Here's a big, tannic and dry Syrah, the kind that needs either some aging or serious decanting to come around. It's a very fine wine, with a deep, plush core of plums, blackberries and leathery carob flavors, but there's an astringency to the middle through the finish. Air it for a few hours, or wait until after mid-2008.",Top Block,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Russian Hill
US,"Angeline is one of the best second labels in California, in this case from Martin Ray. This '08 Sauvignon smacks of ripe, tangy Asian pear, gooseberry, fig, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors brightened by wonderfully crisp acidity. Just beautiful, and a nice bargain at this price.",,90,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Angeline
US,"Acidity marks this Chardonnay. It gives a tart, mouth-cleansing citrusy scour to the lemon and lime and pineapple flavors that finish so dry. It's a minimalist wine, with a minerally frame, and quite good with shellfish.",Estate Bottled,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"Lots of plush, ripe sour cherry, currant, cola and pomegranate flavors in this dry, silky wine, but also lots of tannins. Like chewing on a grape skin, with the resulting astringency. Needs time. Better after 2010.",Hallberg Vineyard,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.",,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Of The Place
US,"A little rough and scoury, but fine and crisp and clean, with a slight sweetness from the dosage enriching the citrus, apple, yeast and vanilla flavors. Fancy and elegant.",Brut Rosé,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Almost sweet in pineapple custard, marzipan and butterscotch flavors, and there may even be a bit of residual sugar in this honey-rich Chard. Saved by a crisp backbone of acidity.",OFS,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Good everyday Chard, with direct flavors of pineapples and kiwis, and the buttercream and smoky vanillins that oak barrels contribute. Finishes dry and crisp.",,86,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Owner/winemaker Oded Shakked was until recently the longtime winemaker at J Wine Co. Now he's doing his own thing, and this is his personal vineyard, in prime Pinot Noir country along Westside Road. The wine is softly opulent in blueberry, blackberry and coffee flavors, with a melted chocolate richness balanced by rich, ripe tannins. Drink now.",Dakine Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"Volume is what this Zin is all about. The vineyard is in the warmest part of the valley, and the grapes sure did get ripe. They flood the mouth with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice and red plums, with a peppery, briary quality and a finish so softly sweet, it's almost chocolaty. Just yummy.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a polished, really likeable Chard. It offers everything the variety should: a rich, creamy texture, brisk acidity, and ripe, delicious flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and kiwis coated with vanilla.",,90,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"This is the least expensive of Barnett's new single-vineyard Pinots, but it's also the richest and tastiest. It's a luscious wine, filling the mouth with cherry, currant, cola, sassafras or root beer, vanilla and anise flavors, wrapped into a silky texture. Feels luxurious and fine. Drink now through 2013.",Tina Marie Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett
US,"A really nice Sauvignon Blanc. Fundamentally dry, but rich in fruity extract, it shows crisp, creamy flavors of pineapples, limes, sweet Meyer lemons, vanilla and smoky oak, girded by a firm minerality. Shows how well the cool Russian River Valley can treat this variety.",,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Ledson
US,"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.",Nugent Vineyard,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"Pretty expensive for a rosé, but it's a seriously good, crisp wine from a premier Pinot producer. It features elegant strawberry, rose petal, tea and dried herb flavors that change with every sip. A dash of Syrah seems to add body and richness.",Vin Gris of Pinot Noir,90,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Here's one of the bigger, more dramatic Russian River Pinots of the vintage. Dark, medium- to full-bodied and fairly tannic, the wine needs time to throw off some weight and reveal its pretty cherry fruit. Hold until 2008; should drink well through 2012.",Dutton Ranch Sanchietti Vineyard,90,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Achieves the alchemy of well-toasted oak and perfectly ripe fruit to produce this luscious, creamy Chardonnay. Mangoes, papayas, pineapple custard, caramel, vanilla, it's all there, along with crisp, balancing acidity.",Reserve,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"A bit on the hot, unbalanced side. Despite dryness, ripe cherry pie, cola, cinnamon and sweet vanilla flavors and a gentle, silky texture, there's some burn, and not a lot of depth. Drink now.",Maboroshi Vineyard,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"One hundred percent new French oak is the dominant theme here. It floods the mouth with the flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. The oak influence is strong, but the underlying wine has some equally strong pineapple, mango and apple fruit. It's made in a rich California style you either love or hate.",,91,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Parallel
US,"This is a polished, pretty wine of great power. It displays a dazzling array of red and black cherry, raspberry, currant and licorice flavors, tinged with mocha and cedar. Has a certain young vine freshness. Mid-term cellaring for a couple years will help it knit together.",Coopersmith,89,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, lightly delicate and elegantly silky, yet with powerhouse flavors that impress. Floods the palate with wild red cherry, cola, sandalwood and cinnamon spice flavors, excited with clean acidity. Drink now.",Reserve,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"A very lush, fruity wine, if a bit soft, with flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. Satisfies for its richness and creamy texture.",Four Hearts Vineyards,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"The best of Korbel's sparkling wines, and one that can stand next to bubblies that cost two or three times as much. Rich and dry, it has a very creamy mouthfeel, with subtle, complex flavors of lime, grapefruit, strawberry and yeast. It's a brut-style wine made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.",Natural,91,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Korbel
US,"This is a very flamboyant Chardonnay. The grapes are superripe in pie-filling pineapples, nectarines and oranges, enhanced with smoky oak and sweet buttered popcorn, but the finish is completely dry. Drink now with rich fare, like lobster and shellfish.",,91,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gann
US,"A big improvement over the '06, ripe and rich in flavor, and capable of aging. The wine is dry and silky, with deep, impressive flavors of cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and sandalwood, as well as Burgundian, earthy notes of mushrooms and balsam. Delicious now, yet the tannins suggest a glidepath through 2013.",,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Olson Ogden
US,"There's something exuberantly old-fashioned about this Pinot. It's dark, dry and tannicly rustic, with huge, gobby, fresh cherry pie flavors deep inside. Swan Pinots last for a long time; give this one five years to soften and melt those tannins.",Trenton Estate,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This refreshing wine has that extra something that pushes it to the next level. Shows deliciously ripe lime, lemon and sweet grass flavors that show little oak influence, letting the fruit and spice shine. Without malo, the wine is sprightly in mouth-cleansing acidity.",,89,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Longboard
US,"Made in a very ripe, very oaky manner, this Chardonnay is extraordinarily rich now, if not very subtle. It's all about power. Buttered toast, caramel cream, pineapple marmalade, lime, orange and spice flavors flood the mouth, snapping to an oaky finish.",Zio Tony Ranch,88,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",Director's Cut,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Very ripe and lush, this Pinot shows deep flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla fudge, mint, cinnamon, nutmeg and sandalwood. It's at its silky, exotic best now and for a few more years.",Nugent Vineyard,89,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"A lovely, bright and crisp wine that does a great job of cleaning the palate. With brisk acidity, it shows tangy flavors of limes, passionfruit and pepper spice.",,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
US,"Marimar Torres frankly calls the planting of these 2 varieties in her estate vineyard, which had previously been to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, experimental. Much work needs to be done to perfect them. The wine, as it stands, is dry and acidic and one-dimensional in cherry and currant fruit. It requires greater levels of complexity and nuance.",Don Miguel Vineyard Syrah-Tempraillo,85,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Marimar Estate
US,"World-famous Rochioli doesn't want to use their own Cabernet grapes, so they sell them to former J Wine Co. winemaker Oded Shakked, who carefully crafts this dry, full-bodied 100% Cabernet. It's young, acidic and tannic, but with its polished core of cherries, should ease well into the next decade.",Rochioli Vineyard,88,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"This is a balanced, easy to drink Chardonnay, with citrus, peach and green apple flavors that have been finished with a veneer of smoky oak. It's totally dry. Do not overchill it, as it's a delicate wine that needs some warmth to open up.",OFS,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Acorn, which does such interesting things with Rhône varieties, shows it's no slouch with Bordeaux varieties, to judge from this fresh, succulent young red wine. It's medium-bodied and dry, with polished flavors of cherries, blueberries, leather and herbs and a long, spicy finish.",Alegria Vineyards,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Acorn
US,"One of the first wines from De Loach after the Boisset takeover, this dry Gewürz is a good portent for the future. It's ultraclean and crisp, with very deep and satisfying flavors of Asian spices, peaches, litchi and citrus.",Early Harvest,87,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,De Loach
US,"Although there's lots to like in this Zin, it's just too sweet. On the plus side are rich, complex flavors of cherry pie, raspberry tart, cassis, cocoa and mushu plum sauce, accented by peppery spices and a bit of wood. Also nice are the dense but ripe tannins. But then there's that sugary, brownie taste that's inappropriate in a table wine.",,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Bone-dry, earthy and gritty yet not really tannic, this is one of those wines that goes with almost anything calling for a dry red. There's a cherry tone and peppery finish that suggest tender beef.",Alegria Vineyards,84,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Dolcetto,Acorn
US,"You don't want to drink this wine now. It's way too tannic, which also accentuates the acidity. It all makes for a tough palate experience, despite rich raspberry, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. So stash this vastly interesting Pinot Noir in your cellar for 3–5 years. But if you can't, decant. Even overnight.",Westside Road Neighbors,91,67,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The vineyard is virtually in Dry Creek Valley, so it's not surprising to find the briary, brambly intensity of that warm Sonoma appellation. It's a good, lush, likeable Zin, brimming with wild berry, leather, tobacco and pepper spice flavors swimming in firm, dry tannins.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,89,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,John Tyler
US,"Almost nobody in California makes a Columbard, especially in a high-rent district like Russian River, but this white wine deserves your attention. It's dry and very crisp in acidity, with flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, pears, honeysuckle flowers and spices. Great as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio.",Old Vines,89,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Colombard,Y Rousseau
US,"This is the best Jewel Block bottling ever from Dutton. The vineyard is in the heart of Green Valley, one of the coolest parts of Russian River, and the magnificent vintage has yielded a fantastically ripe wine, balanced with rich, crisp acidity. The flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, tangerine zest and dusty Asian spices are rich and deep, but the wine is very young. Give it until mid-2008, and it will drink well through 2013, at least.",Jewel Block Vineyard,94,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"This is one of the palest Pinots of the vintage, so translucent, you can hardly believe its power. A blend of various Dutton Ranch vineyards the result is serious and fabulous, a complex wine with cherry, cola and spice flavors and a luxuriously silky texture. This is textbook, world class RRV Pinot from a very great vintage.",Karmen Isabella,94,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Beautiful, irresistable Syrah, lush and sweet in fruit and oak. Soft and velvety, it offers layers of puréed raspberries, cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a rich edge of toasted marshmallow, gingerbread and butterscotch. Yet it's dry, with modest alcohol.",,94,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Merry Edwards nailed this one. Lush and smooth as velvet, it shows enormously deep, ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, leather, cola, soy-splashed Portobello, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. But it's also a very young wine, to judge from the freshness of acids and tannins. Drink now, with decanting, and should age well for up to a decade.",Olivet Lane Méthode a l'Ancienne,94,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Arista's basic Pinot, which contains some Anderson Valley fruit, is textbook cool-climate Pinot, very dry and quite acidic. It's a little diluted, but enjoyable for its cherry, cola and toast flavors that finish in a great burst of peppery spice.",,87,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Quite a bit sweeter on the palate than J's Pinot Gris in the past, with a sugary edge to the otherwise pretty pineapple, vanilla and wildflower flavors. Acidity helps to balance, but this is not, strictly speaking, dry.",,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Heavily oaked with well-charred wood, so you get lots of upfront toast. Below is a nice Chard with pleasant peach and apple flavors. Finishes dry and spicy.",,84,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bearboat
US,"Testarossa held back the release date for a while, but this is still a pretty tannic wine. Feels heavy and furry, although the complex black cherry, plum and bacon flavors break through to impress. A bit awkward tasted in the Spring of 2009, but could evolve after mid-2010.",Fritschen Vineyard,88,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,88,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Very vibrant in acidity and bright green fruit character, suggesting limes, lychee and lemongrass. A drop of Viognier and a tiny percent of oak add softening, enriching notes. Very fine and dry. Good with ceviche, grilled veggies on bruschetta topped with melted goat cheese.",Block Collection River Ranches,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
US,"Here's a gusty, bold Zin whose powerhouse flavors call for equally strong fare, such as braised short ribs and barbecue. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with explosive flavors of blackberries, plums, anise, balsamic-splashed sautéed mushrooms, espresso, tabasco and pepper. Finishes a bit Porty in raisins. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is just too young to drink now. The interplay of the acids and tannins locks down the flavors and make a sting on the palate. But there is the terrific core of flavor, of ripe blackberries and cherries, of red and black currants, of cola and root beer and licorice, that will emerge in time, making for delicious drinking. Best 2009–2013, possibly longer.",Quail Hill Vineyard,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"The price is right, but the wine is ordinary. It's a modest little Pinot Noir, silky and dry, with suggestions of cherries, tangerine peel and cola.",,84,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Angeline
US,"Richer and tarter than Kenwood's regular '05 Chard, this wine shows the acidity and green apple flavors of the central part of the valley. Bosc pears, Meyer lemons and white peaches pleasantly complicate things as you continue to sip.",Reserve,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood
US,"Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards. It's almost what the French call demi-sec, with sugared lemon mousse and raspberry-vanilla cream flavors.",Vintage Brut,84,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Compared to the winery's Starr Ridge Chard from the same vintage, this is unassertive. It's thicker in the mouth, and softer, with a malted, custard texture framing peach flavors.",Westside Farms,86,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"There's not much, if any, oak on this Chardonnay, leaving the fresh, clean fruit flavors to star. Shows a rich array of pineapples, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots and peaches, with spicy, vanilla overtones. Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rued
US,"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished Sauvignon benefits from very high acidity that makes those tastebuds whistle. It shows fig, Tequila, grapefruit and nectarine flavors and a finish of white pepper. Notable for its dry, keen freshness.",,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
US,"The home vineyard is in a cool, southeastern part of the valley, and you can smell the minerality in this crisp, young wine, grown in the fog. It's exceptionally bright in steely tangerine, kiwi and pineapple flavors whose smoky oak veneer is in perfect balance.",Proprietor Grown,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanna
US,"Despite some well-ripened red and black currant, licorice and cola flavors, this dry Zin has a bitterness in the finish that gives it a bit of a rustic feel. Drink now.",Gilsson Vineyard,84,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Tin Barn
US,"Tastes candy sweet, with cherry, raspberry, licorice, caramel and vanilla flavors. But the acidity and silky texture win points.",,84,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mia's Playground
US,"Merlot is tricky under the best circumstances, and this one is adequate, at best. Dry and fairly tannic, it shows modest, somewhat overripe blackberry flavors.",Estate,83,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Foppiano
US,"Shows a distinctly rustic note in the jagged tannins, green acids and somewhat thin blackberry fruit that's stretched with dill and mint. Sweet oak helps to fatten it up.",Estate,83,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Foppiano
US,"With apricot, pineapple, rice wine vinegar and white sugar flavors, this wine tastes like a sweet-and-sour sauce in a Chinese restaurant. The acidity is emphasized on the prickly finish.",Angeline,83,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Martin Ray
US,"From Domaine St. George, a polished, ripe wine, from a premier growing region. It's dry and a little rough in texture, with complex flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, and a cleansing espresso bitterness to the finish.",,86,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,STG
US,"Dry and richly oaked, with ripe flavors, this is a big Chardonnay. It shows massive flavors of pineapple custard, pear jam, butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. A bit direct, but a crowd pleaser.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"There's a rusticity here that's partly a function of Zin's wild, brambly nature, and partly due to a raisiny sweet finish. On the plus side is a rich, round mouthfeel and delicious cherry, cranberry and mocha fruit and spice. The September harvest heat wave must have been a huge challenge, even for talented grapegrowers such as the Duttons.",,85,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Acorn has produced one of their best bottlings ever. The wine is drily crisp and tannic, but rich and supple, with cassis, cherry and carob flavors that have an earthy, mushroom and tobacco grounding. The wine contains smaller amounts of at least 10 other varieties, in the manner of an old field blend.",Alegria Vineyards Heritage Vines,91,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Acorn
US,"A bit on the simple side, but likeable for its cherry pie filling, blackberry jam, cola and spicy coffee fruit that fill the mouth with flavor. Thoroughly dry, the wine is elegantly smooth and balanced. Drink now.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"Raw and hot, with a burnt cherry pie taste and a dry, tannic finish.",Estate,82,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Foppiano
US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",Mills Vineyard,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.",Hopkins Vineyard,86,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Not much going on. Clean and dry, with watery flavors of apples and oak.",Indindoli Vineyard,83,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Waugh Cellars

US,"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished SB benefits from crisp acidity provoked by its cool growing region. The flavors are of figs, citrus fruits and nectarines, but they could be a bit more focused.",,85,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
US,"A market glut of Pinot Noir grapes and wine is resulting in more vintners offering the variety as a blush. Consumers are the beneficiaries. This delightful wine is delicate, silky and dry, with tangy acids framing subtle strawberries and cream flavors.",Pinot Noir Rosé,86,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"The winery specializes in single-vineyard wines, and this is certainly a unique Chardonnay, but it's not an opulent one. On the contrary, it's flinty, acidic and raspingly dry, which makes one think it was picked early. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with its puckery lemon flavors.",Searby Vineyard,85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nickel & Nickel
US,"Smells herbal and minty, which is strange given the vintage's heat, and tastes earthy, too, with oregano and barely ripe cherry flavors. Turns dry and crisp on the finish. Consider this an elegant style.",Dutton Ranch,85,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"This is a clean, dry earthy, acidic wine, but it's a little thin in fruit, and lovers of Viognier's opulence will be disappointed, despite the elegance. The flavors veer toward lemon zest and minerals.",,84,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Arger-Martucci
US,"Very ripe, almost jammy in apricots, pineapples and pears, this Chard seems sweet, like sugared or honeyed pie-filling. The finish is a bit cloying.",,82,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mia's Playground
US,"This blend of mainly Syrah, with Grenache, is heavy and dull, with candied raspberry-cherry flavors that finish a little sweet.",Dry,82,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Martin Ray
US,"Some people are sensitive to the green, minty gooseberry aroma that strongly permeates this wine. If you can deal with that, the flavors veer toward slightly sweet pineapples, peaches, melons and vanilla.",,82,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"Very gentle and fruity and so easy to drink. Flatters with waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, milk chocolate and anise, yet balanced with fine tannins and a dry, crisp finish. Drink now.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hook & Ladder
US,"A fine evocation of a Russian River Pinot from a good vintage. It's dry and silky and crisp, with rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, cedar, cinnamon and pepper. Delicious. Drink now.",,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"Nice and direct in ripe fruit and oak flavors, this is textbook proper Chardonnay. The flavors are of tropical fruits and spice, the texture is creamy, the finish is long and spicy.",,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"Very ripe in the mouth, with mounds of black cherry and mocha flavors, this Pinot has a full-bodied, slightly heavy feeling. It's dry and silky, and a nice example of a good Russian River Pinot from a warm vintage.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"A touch of barnyard funk gives this Pinot an old-fashioned Burgundian touch. But the fruit is all California, suggesting ripe cherries and raspberries, coated with plenty of sweet, smoky oak. A very nice, high-class Pinot Noir for drinking now and through 2013.",,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"It's amazing how rich this is, given the pale, translucent ruby color. Waves of cherries, raspberries, roasted hazelnuts, cola, pomegranates, herb tea, dusty Asian spices and smoky oak change constantly in the glass, as the wine breathes and endlessly fascinates. Bone-dry and tartly crisp, the wine will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,95,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Dryness and acidity mark this terrific wine. It's one for connoisseurs, a Pinot that requires some understanding to fully appreciate, as it's not a hedonistic seducer. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a fruit-skin bitterness, and there are additional nuances of violets, cola, leather, balsam and smoky oak. This is certainly one for the cellar. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next eight years.",Allen Vineyard Hillside Blocks,94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"The 2005 vintage was a good one for the vineyard, cool and steady, yielding dry, balanced wines, including this low-production Syrah. The tannins are of the furry-fuzzy kind, framing blackberry, cola, tobacco, vanilla and sage flavors.",Alegria Vineyards Axiom,90,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"Try this as a refreshing alternative to Chardonnay. It's drier and more tart than most RRV Chards, but otherwise is similar in the oak-infused pineapple, peach, pear, orange and spice flavors and rich, creamy texture.",Dutton Ranch Shop Blanc,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",Olivet Lane Estate Reserve,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"Oaky, tannic and somewhat twiggy and minty to start, this Pinot has modest cherry and cola flavors. It's not showing particularly well, with some tightness, but gets fruitier and more charming as it breathes.",Lindley's Knoll,85,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"Dry and distinctly wild in brambly, briary berry fruit and spice. At first this Zin feels rustic, with a sandpapery grip and fresh, juicy acids. But the brilliant structure of acidity, bracing tannins and caressing mouthfeel reveal how delicate this really is. This is great Zinfandel.",Lone Redwood Ranch,94,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Israeli-born winemaker Oded Shakked has specialized in cool-climate Syrah and his passion shows in this evocative wine. It is clearly modeled on the wines of the Northern Rhône, with its peppery aroma, cherry flavors and thick tannins.",,87,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids.",Feeney Vineyard,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Could be a bit firmer and more structured in acidity. Shows a soft, easy, silky texture, with forward flavors of melted blackberry jam, sour red cherry, cola, and cinnamon spice, with some bitterness in the finish. Drink now.",The Whitewing Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
US,"Clean, dry and crisp in acidity, this wine has citrus and fig flavors, with an edge of tangy gooseberry. It's nice and elegant, but finishes a little thin.",Marino Vineyard,84,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Crinella
US,"Interesting and aromatic. Notes of honey, apricot and clover aromas. Quite tight and lean in the mouth, but with mouthwatering flavors of crisp green apple, lime and mineral. Finishes sharp and wet, with piercing acidity. An individual wine.",Block Collection River Road Ranch,90,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.",Dutton Ranch Dutton Palms Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"Nearly five years after it was made, this Syrah remains dark and tannic, but the fruit is starting to make the magical transition from primary to secondary. It's picking up dried blackberry, dessicated blueberry and beef jerky flavors that finish long and spicy. Yet it still has youthful acidity and freshness. This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is a new wine from Longboard. The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the Middle Reach area that is prime Pinot country. But somehow, Merlot loves it. Softly lush and complex, with blackberry, blueberry, cherry, cola and spiced coffee flavors, finishing with new oaky vanillins. Really notable for its balance and harmony.",DaKine Vineyard,92,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard
US,"Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy. Acidity is high, and gives a tangy minerality that adds complexity.",Dutton Ranch Kyndall's Reserve,92,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"Siduri's basic Russian River bottling is very ripe in fruit, heavy in texture and soft, with a cherry, coffee and chocolate syrup flavor. It's as tasty as a candy. Drink now.",,84,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"The problem here is a lack of fruit. Except for a hint of Chardonnay peaches and cream, you get little beyond alcohol and acidity. But it's a clean wine.",,82,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Easily the best Hanna Pinot Noir in memory, this pretty wine is light and crisp and delicious, with cherry, cola, cocoa, anise and spice flavors. Nice now with lamb chops, roast salmon.",,87,31,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanna
US,"An elegant, nicely varietal Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's dry and silky, with crisp acidity framing charming flavors of cherries, rhubarb pie, cola and pepper spice.",Reserve,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Very rich and opulent, if a little soft. Offers an explosion of ripe black cherries, raspberries, licorice, mocha, black pepper and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on.",Carlisle Vineyard,87,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy
US,"Light-bodied, soft and pastry-rich, with easy flavors of cherry, raspberry and vanilla granola. Nice now, with its silky texture and instant appeal.",Chenoweth Ranch,87,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Pinotphiles will appreciate that this was 100% destemmed for fermentation. The fruit is the star, suggesting freshly crushed blackberries, cherries, black raspberries and cola, spiced up with cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. An elegant sipper that gets better as it warms. Try decanting for a couple hours before serving.",,89,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Verve
US,"Oh, how good this wine smells, like a garden in June, or a basket of freshly picked fruits dusted with spice, or wild honey drizzed over toasted macadamia nuts. This isn't a wine to ponder over, it's to enjoy with grilled shrimp on a skewer with roasted red peppers and onions.",Del Rio Vineyard,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Louis M. Martini
US,"Made in a lighter, earthier style, but still showing plenty of class. It's dry and silky, with sour cherry candy and spice flavors. Good value for a Pinot of this elegance.",,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Magness
US,"For the price, this dessert wine is quite a good buy in an upscale sweetie. It shows honeyed flavors of apricots, pineapples, oranges, vanilla fudge and cinnamon spice.",Oley Sweet,87,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
US,"Few wineries in California any longer produce this Chardonnay-like French variety, but Dutton-Goldfield continues to do a good job. It has a creamy texture, with flavors of peaches, green apples, pears, vanilla and cinnamon spice. With no oak, it's a clean, crisply acidic wine.",Dutton Ranch Shop Block,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Too acidic and sweet for my tastes, with well-ripened cherry and mocha flavors that are certainly flattering. The sweetness seems to get stronger as the wine warms up, making it an awkward sip.",Winemaker's Block Selection,83,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"Enormously ripe berries characterize this wine; it explodes with wild raspberries, cherries, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a peppery, minty finish. But it's young and vigorous in rich, dense tannins, suggesting ageability. Best now, with decanting, and for several years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a unique wine with an unusual and impressive bouquet of peach smoke, cocoa and hazelnut. Balanced but firm on the palate, it offers robust fruit and spice flavors and mint, toast and nut accents. There's even an intriguing kirsch-like cherry note in here. Full-bodied, it's a wine of real individual character that finishes dense, long and spicy.",Don Miguel Vineyard Dobles Lías,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Torres
US,"Four different clones are separately fermented and then blended to make this unique bottling. An expansive nose shows vibrant pineapple, peach, and orange fruit with lemondrop and butterscotch accents. It's rich and mouthfilling, like a bite of banana cream pie, and turns maybe a bit orangey-sweet. Shy on subtlety, it packs in a lot of juicy flavor.",Three Jacks Vineyard,89,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.",OFS,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"A brisk, clean Chardonnay with a firm footing of minerals undergirding polished pineapple, pear and cedar flavors. Offers lots of sophisticated pleasure at a good price.",Barrel Reserve,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Toasted Head
US,"A bit overripe in raisins, with a chocolate-currant core enriched with smoky new oak. But the texture is silky and fine, and the finish is dry and spicy. Drink now.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longboard
US,"Shows good character in the dryness, crispness, smooth tannins and silky texture that frame ripe cherry pulp, cola, vanilla and pepper flavors. On the minus side is a sharply acidic finish. Drink soon.",Heintz Ranch,87,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutch Bill Creek
US,"A very rich Syrah, packed with pepper, blackberries, currants, cherries, cola and licorice, and wrapped into the smoothest tannins you can imagine. Offers a lot of complexity and a beautiful, long finish.",Christensen Family Vineyard,88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"The '05 has produced a fresh, brisk young wine that's firm in immature acids and young, jammy cherry and black raspberry fruit. Its pedigree shows in the balance and the rich, ripe tannins that only a superior cool-climate vineyard can provide. But it's too young now, and hasn't proven itself capable of aging. Try after 2008.",Dutton Ranch Sanchietti Vineyard,88,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Tannic now, but with such a solid heart of fruit, it should blossom by the end of 2008 or early 2009. The color is translucent ruby, the texture wonderfully silky and light, except for those hard tannins. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, cranberries, cola and pomegranates are just waiting to emerge.",,88,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Big, raw and frankly not really showing its best now, this young Zin needs time in the bottle. It has everything that it takes for two or three years aging, at least. Aromas and flavors of crushed pepper, fennel seed and cardamom spice up the blackberry, roasted coffee and bitter chocolate flavors, while the tannins are hefty, but negotiable.",Feeney Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"DoesnÕt smell or taste like a typical California Viognier. The grass, hay and gooseberry aromatics lead you to expect a dry wine. But then it turns almost shockingly sweet in the mouth, with the flavor of pineapple juice. Bizarre and discomforting.",Staley Vineyard,83,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Philip Staley
US,"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Grown in the cool heart of the valley, but in a hot vintage, this beautifully ripe Pinot combines fruity power with elegant harmony to produce a delicious, complex wine. It's sturdy in acids and tannins, and bone dry. While the alcohol is high, it feels balanced and graceful. Best in its youthful flamboyance.",Saralee's Vineyard,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine. It's a decidedly candy-sweet combination of butterscotch, peach and nut flavors with a soft, round mouthfeel. The light orange finish is easy. If you have good friends who just don't like dry wines, this is a great one to serve them.",Reserve,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ledson
US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality. Has all the body and length you could want, if not quite all the balance and finesse.",Rochioli Vineyard,87,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Some very appealing apple, asian pear, mint, smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even, medium-weight wine. It has fine fruit-to-acid balance and offers apple-peach flavors with a mild but evident butterscotch element. The tangy oak that's present from the start shows most prominently on the spicy finish.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rudd
US,"Young and strong now, with a dry mouthfeel and firm acidity and tannins, this fine Pinot should develop with age. The cherry, mocha, cola and rhubarb flavors are deep and long, and together with the silky texture, offer great pleasure. Drink now through 2010.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"A nice Syrah that appeals for its lush flavors. It's too soft, with a melted quality, but the blackberry, chocolate, leather, anise and pepper flavors are so tasty, you hardly notice.",,86,12,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Duende
US,"A nice, easy drinking Sauvignon Blanc that shows the citrusy acids that make this variety so popular. Shows pineapple, honeysuckle, orange blossom, lemon zest and vanilla spice flavors that finish a little sweet, but clean and zesty.",,86,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"Sharp and dry, this Chianti-style wine has cherry, date, grilled mushroom, balsam and vanilla flavors. The nicest part is the silky texture, light and elegant, like a Pinot Noir. Needs rich meats, pasta or risotto to show its best.",Alegría Vineyards,88,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Acorn
US,"Unbalanced, with a hot, Porty mouthfeel and medicinal, sweet-and-sour cherry flavors.",Dolinsek Ranch Reserve,82,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mara
US,"This smooth wine has good balance, and a fairly full mouthfeel. Even on the palate, it shows a bit of both ends of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum—the crisp grassy, herb and grapefruit side and also fig, pear and melon as foundation.",,86,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Made in the modern, ripe California stlyle, this Chardonnay offers immediately appealing flavors of pineapple jam, peach, lime, kiwi and vanilla oak. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Ready now for sheer richness.",,87,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Paul Wines
US,"This is a big, spicy, powerful Zinfandel that brims with berry, cherry, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. It's not particularly subtle, but slams into the palate like an asteroid from space. Calls for barbecue, pure and simple.",Allegria Vineyards Heritage Vines,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Acorn
US,"This is a good, everyday Merlot with some additional qualities of elegance. It's soft and mellow, with nice flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, chocolate and licorice.",,86,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Angeline
US,"Lots to like in this rich, peppery Syrah. It's a full-bodied, complex sipper, with subtlely earthy flavors of blackberries, blueberries, carob and figs. Good price for a wine of this polish.",Vanessa's Vineyard,88,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,River Road
US,"A few years in the cellar will soften and sweeten this fresh wine. Currently, it shows its youth with a tough dryness and acidity that give a resistant edge to the cherry, cola, root beer and new oak flavors. Hold until 2009; should develop complexity through 2011.",,88,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Olson Ogden
US,"Rochioli's estate Chard, as opposed to their single-vineyard or block bottlings, needs a really stellar year to shine. It's a very good wine, with crisp mineral, date and pineapple flavors, but lacks the richness and complexity that come with warmer vintages.",,88,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"An interesting wine that makes you think. Straddles the border between minty wintergreen unripeness and cherry-cola ripeness, coming down in favor of the latter. Streamlined and elegant, it's good now for the dry crispness, but not an ager. Drink soon.",Dutton Thomas Road Vineyard,89,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Call it Chablis-like. This Chard is bone dry, crisp in citrusy acidity, and features stony, minerally flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. Try as a richer alternative to Pinot Grigio.",Lot 115,86,13,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
US,"Offers hints of the winery's great vineyard-designates, but seems overpriced for what you get. The wine is dry and crisp and fruity, with cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb, cola and cedar flavors. Drink through the next few years.",,87,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",Reserve,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Castle Rock
US,"Lots of sweet cherry fruit in this polished red wine, which also shows the char and cedary flavors of oak barrel aging. It's gentle in tannins and has enough acidity for balance. A nice, everyday wine that brings to mind well-sauced pasta dishes.",Alegria Vineyard,86,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Acorn
US,"Shows lots of fine RRV Pinot character without a whole lot of complexity. The wine is elegantly silky and dry, with cherry, cola, pomegranate, rhubarb, herb tea and spice flavors. Drink now.",Scarlett,87,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,River Road
US,"Young and forward, here's a seductive wine that's instantly attractive for its lush flavors and silky mouthfeel. Cherry pie filling, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cocoa and coffee flavors mark this delicious Pinot, which finishes with crisp acids. It was made by Paul Hobbs.",,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stewart
US,"A distinctive Chardonnay made in the Farrell style, which leans toward acidic and elegant. But this is not an austere wine, far from it. It has a rich minerality and flavors of lime and pineapple custard, and then an even richer crème brûlée finish. Delicious and complex.",Cresta Ridge Vineyard,92,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",Cool Coastal Vineyards,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Chards are tight, acidic and minerally in youth, showing a lees-infused structure but offering waves of complexity. With toasty oak, the base flavors are of nectarines, mangoes, peaches, zesty green apples and dustings of Asian spice.",Don Miguel Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"The oak stands out, giving this Pinot a vanilla, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast dominance over the underlying cherry jam fruit. Although the texture is nice and silky, the wine itself feels simple, especially at this price.",Mill Station Road,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Paul Wines
US,"A fruity-oaky and rather simple Pinot Noir. Offers plenty of upfront cherry-berry and cola fruit, with a kiss of oak, wrapped into a silky texture.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Paul Wines
US,"Here's a very dry, stylish Pinot, and while it has plenty of fruit, it has mushroom, balsamic and soy flavors that deepen and ground the cherries and cola. The overall impression is of a young, complex, fleshy Pinot that should hold and develop for five years.",Don Miguel Vineyard,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"The cool vintage in this cool region has yielded a wine with grapefruit, lime and wildflower. There's no oak, so the fruit is front and center, along with vibrant acidity.",Shone Farm,86,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Benziger
US,"Most of the grapes came from esteemed Dutton vineyards. The wine is enormously ripe. The juice was barrel fermented and aged sur lie. Creamy, packed with tropical fruit and smoky vanilla flavors, it's hedonistically delicious, but almost as sweet as a dessert wine.",,86,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Girard
US,"Rich and forward in spicy fruit, with a sweet rhubarb edge veering into cola and cocoa. Finishes with an elegant flourish of oak-infused fruit. A complex, multi-layered wine that will handle some years of bottle age.",,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Lovely and complicated; a Pinot Noir for Cabernet lovers. It has Pinot's silky texture and soft tannins, but also a full-bodied, oak-infused weight that carries wonderfully ripe cherry pie, anise, cola and raspberry flavors that change from sip to sip.",,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belvedere
US,"A bit disappointing. Starts off with an exciting blast of cherry, cola, pomegranate and smoky vanilla aromas, but turns thin in the mouth, with only modest cherry and tamari flavors.",,86,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Heavy, with blackberry and blueberry jam and pepper flavors wrapped into strong tannins. It's a dry, well-ripened wine, but needs greater liveliness and complexity, especially at this price.",Allegria Vineyards Axiom,85,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"Very dry, delicately structured and crisp, with a mushroomy, leathery earthiness that adds extra layers to the cherry and cola flavors. A lovely, silky, complex Pinot that should hold well through 2010.",Tara Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Russian Hill
US,"Pours dark and smells youthful, with cherry, raspberry, cola and spice scents. In the mouth, it's a big wine that's stuffed with cherry pie and oak flavors. It's also fairly tannic, which should enable it to age for a few years. This is a success for the vintage.",Five Sisters,90,80,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Very clean and dry, high in citrusy acidity, and with a steely minerality. This streamlined Chard aims for structure, not opulence. The flavors are of white peaches and smoky oak. Defines the Farrell style of detailed elegance.",Russian River Selection,90,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Light in color, with refined aromatics showing cola, rosehip tea, leather, floral and Asian spice notes. This delicately structured wine is on the light-bodied side, but it's complex and could be exciting with some bottle age. Best now through 2012.",Poule d'Or,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Eric Ross
US,"Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.",Bacigalupi Vineyards,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",Sonoma Reserve,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"From this hot vintage, the wine is enormously ripe, with a baked-fruit character. Yet it retains classic Russian River cola, cherry and rhubarb pie flavors along with rich tannins and crisp acids. It's a powerful, robust wine.",,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fritz
US,"Soft, slightly sweet and simple, this Syrah has fairly modest blackberry, licorice flavors and cola flavors. Drink now.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,85,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Flavorful in cherries, cola, tea and dusty spices, with a silky texture, this is a good introductory Pinot Noir.",,84,13,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bogle
US,"Starts with a strong burst of charry, caramelized new wood, then in the mouth it turns very ripe, dense and oaky, with primary Pinot fruit and some dusty tannins. On airing, more complex notes of mushrooms and soy emerge.",,88,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"The taste is dominated by sweet vanilla and caramelly oak. Buried under that are tropical fruit, pear and kiwi flavors. While the acidity is nice and crisp, the wine is too oaky.",Reserve Selection,84,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Aromatically inviting, with clean, focused cherry, pomegranate, cola and oak scents leading to a full-bodied palate. A little heavy and hot, but otherwise a very nice Pinot that can hold for a few years.",Emily's Cuvée,88,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mueller
US,"Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries.",Odyssey,83,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Enkidu

US,"Cecil De Loach was famous for his Zinfandels when he owned De Loach Winery, and he shows his deft hand with this wine. It's not one of those kick-butt Zins, but instead it is balanced and medium-bodied, just a little heavier than Pinot Noir, with fine fruit and spice. What a great food wine.",,87,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hook & Ladder

US,"Too sweet, with jellied peach, pineapple and apricot flavors. Without the sugary taste this would be a really good Chard.",Hopkins Vineyard,83,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak.",,83,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Derbes
US,"Here's a nice, fairly complex Chard that's ripe and toasty and full of peach, pear, green apple and cantaloupe flavors. Finishes dry and spicy-clean.",Reserve,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"Good Russian River Pinot that's very ripe and pretty tannic. Stuffed with lipsmacking cherry, blackberry, cola and cocoa flavors. Feels thick and a little soft and heavy in the mouth. Not an ager.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Scherrer
US,"No oak lets the basic wine show through, but the problem is that it's unbalanced. It's sugary sweet in peach and apricot flavors, with a harsh, burnt finish.",Unoaked,82,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mossback
US,"Dry and focused in acids, the wine shows the balance and complexity of the vineyard, as well as its ageworthiness. It's very young now, with immature raspberry, cola, rum punch, balsamic, mushroom and Asian spice flavors, but decanting and slow warming in the glass help elevate it. Nonetheless, your best bet is the cellar. Best after 2008, and for many years after, depending on how old you like your wines.",Allen Vineyard,96,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A brilliant young Pinot that magically combines instant drinkability with ageworthiness. Silky and supple, the wine has broad, deep raspberry, cherry, cola, cocoa and spice flavors that are wrapped into sweet, fine tannins, leading to a long, complicated finish. Just gorgeous from the first sniff to the last sip, and should age well through 2015.",Flax Vineyard,96,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is always one of Williams Selyem's most complex, interesting wines. The ‘05 is especially layered, showing a silky, elegant mouthfeel that frames extraordinarily lush flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, root beer and dusty Asian spices. Dry and elegant, it's a gorgeous Pinot Noir now, and should develop bottle complexity through 2015.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,95,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Dry, earthy and not showing a lot now, this closed wine needs decanting or a bit of bottle age to open up. Presently. a cloud of tannins is hiding ripe cherry, cola and tobacco flavors. Hard to predict where it will end up, but the structure suggests a year or two in the cellar.",Clone 115,87,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moshin
US,"Made in a very ripe, forward style, with cherry jam, chocolate pudding and smoky oak flavorings. This straightforward Pinot flatters with its juicy opulence.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,86,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sapphire Hill
US,"Here's a big, ripe, juicy Zin that's rustic and a little sweet but enjoyable for its purity. Has powerful flavors of raspberry and cherry purée, with a streak of cocoa and peppery spices. It's lighter in body than others, and not very tannic. It packs a punch of acidity.",Estate,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Harvest Moon
US,"This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex.",O.F.S.,95,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"When our tasting panel team tasted the '02 a few years ago, we found it heavy, but possibly a sleeper. The '03 is in the same vein. While it lacks a certain vibrancy and has tannic weight, the deeply flavored core of cherries is impressive and suggests mid-term aging.",Cristina Selection Don Miguel Vineyard,86,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",Allen Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A generous Chardonnay whose spicy taste leads to a crisp, dry finish. The wine is wonderfully ripe, showing pineapple, golden kiwi, Key lime pie and oaky vanilla flavors.",Ruxton,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"This single-vineyard Zin is a considerable improvement over the ‘04. The alcohol in the ‘05 is far lower, almost a full percent, yielding a more balanced and harmonious wine. But it's hardly shy. It's powerful in wild blackberry, cassis, raspberry, root beer, tangerine, chocolate and sweet thyme, while the tannic structure is rich enough to warrant bottle aging for a decade.",Forchini Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"A Syrah of considerable proportions, made in the Novy style of power and ripeness. It's suprising that Novy didn't priced it higher, as it has that extractive richness and inherent wealth of texture that are the domain of expensive red wines. Just tremendous in blackberries, chocolate and spices, with the most beautiful tannins. Drink now, with the finest meats.",Parsons' Vineyard,94,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Good Chardonnay, rich and ripe and steely. That metallic thing shows up both in the crisp acidity and in the stony, pebbly tang that adds a piquant freshness to the pineapple, lime tart, tangerine and smoky custard-cream flavors.",Estate Grown,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"Tart in acidity and a bit austere, this Pinot has an early-picked quality and shows some immature tannins. It's an elegant, streamlined wine with good structure, but leaves you wanting more fruit.",Russian River Selection,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Here's a delicately structured, elegant Pinot that modulates the fruit and ups the acidity. It shows polished cherry, cola and toast flavors, with a mushroomy, herbal earthiness and a light, silky texture. Finishes dry and spicy.",Estate Bottled,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Balletto
US,"This is Cecil De Loach's brand, since he sold his winery to Boisset USA, and it's a nice Russian River Cab of which there aren't many. It shows a cool-climate delicacy and silkiness, but is tasty, with ripe flavors and bright acidity.",Third Alarm Reserve,86,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hook & Ladder
US,"Spicy and fruity and, as the label says, dry. It shows crisp acids and a bright, delicately clean mouthfeel. Kind of like a Sauvignon Blanc except for the exotic tropical fruit and Asian spice flavors.",Estate Dry,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Harvest Moon
US,"Shows young vine jamminess, with fresh, ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. The Williams Selyem balance of acids and tannins of dry elegance is evident, as is the new oak. Complex and supple, this wine needs time in the bottle to show its best. Give it until 2008, and should drink well for years beyond.",Bucher Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Better than the ‘04, due to its greater structure, Bella Luna's ‘05 Pinot has complex acids and tannins. They provides the architecture for the extremely ripe cherry, raspberry and cola flavors that have been liberally aged in new oak. Best now in its flashy, seductive youth.",Bella Luna Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"Sprightly and delicious, with grapefruit, fig, Meyer lemon and apricot flavors made even brighter by vibrant acidity. This elegant SB will be delicious with a salad of bitter greens, figs, chèvre and grilled shrimp.",,91,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Fritz
US,"Clean, dry and tart in acids, this is a minerally Chard with citrus and kiwi flavors. It has some oak that adds richness, but it's not really a rich wine. It's more of a streamlined, sleek sipper.",,85,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Belvedere
US,"Defines a very ripe, varietally true interpretation of Zinfandel. It's the kind of wine the old Italian-American families might have enjoyed in days of old, with its lusty flavors of freshly picked wild berries that were made into jam. The alcohol is on the high side, but the wine is luscious.",E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"A bit too much cat pee for me, although the crisp dryness is appealing. Beyond that, you get ripe grapefruit, lemon peel and passion fruit flavors.",,84,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Fritz
US,"Ripeness was not a problem with this wine, which is fat and unctuous. It shows complex apricot, mineral, pear, green apple and lees flavors that finish with a glyceriney taste of honey. Should develop for a few years in the bottle.",Heintz Vineyard,90,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Too young now. The wine is tannic and acidic, with cherry-berry flavors. It's not really very interesting; instead it's kind of raw and dry. Maybe it will go someplace.",Jack Hill Vineyard,84,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Lots of toast, char and caramel in the aromas, then it turns somewhat heavy and soft, with stewed fruit and espresso flavors. This wine seems to have suffered from the heat.",Estate,84,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanna
US,"A blend of Marsanne and Roussanne, this Rhone white blend offers explosive flavors of baked peaches, pears and spicy mangoes, with even richer, more exotic nuances of litchi, butterscotch, toasted marshmallow, vanilla bean and coconut macaroon.  As this description suggests, it's a big wine, but it's dry and balanced.",Saralee's Vineyard,89,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Luko
US,"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,89,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem

US,"Here's a rich, complex, savory Zin from the coolish south-central part of the valley. The vines were planted only in 2000, but the wine has the density of the old vine Zins that border the vineyard. The wild raspberry, coffee, cola and peppery spice flavors finish thoroughly dry, with rich tannins.",Eight Cousins Vineyard,90,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pellegrini
US,"Polished and fruity, with ripe peach custard, nectarine, pear and spicy green apple flavors enriched with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Crisp acidity makes the wine racy.",,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hook & Ladder
US,"This is a big, ripe Zin from a great vineyard in a warm part of the appellation. There's a lot of heat, but it works well with the blackberry pie, cherry tart and milk chocolate flavors. Nice and dry, if a bit soft.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ledson
US,"There's enough unripe fruity flavor in this wine to detract from its pleasure. As dry, crisp and silky as it is, its cherry and cola flavors are marred by a sharp, green taste of menthol.",,84,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"Rough and common, this Cab tastes frankly sweet, like cherry and pomegranate jelly. It's also harsh, salty and acidic on the finish.",,81,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hook & Ladder
US,"This has picked up softness and a honeyed mouthfeel, as the chemistry of aging on the lees does its magic. The wine has a plush, creamy feeling, with the silky smoothness of a great sparkling wine. Flavorwise, it's all pears, limes, dough and cinnamon spice. Delicious now, and should hold and improve over the next eight years.",Late Disgorged Brut,93,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Great Chardonnay, exotically rich and complex. With the crisp, zesty acidity of Russian River in a cool vintage, the wine is impressively balanced despite its powerhouse flavors. Pineapples, mangoes, papayas, new oak, minerals and Asian spices mingle together, leading to a long finish.",Ritchie Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"This is a complicated young Pinot; and while the parts are all pretty and polished, they haven't knitted together. Voluptuous flavors of cherries, cola, spices and cedar are wrapped into silky tannins, and the acidity is fine and brisk, but as good as the wine is, it seems unfinished, like the score to a symphony that has yet to be played. Give this until mid-2008, and it should be terrific for the next four years.",Nicole's Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Only a fine, cool-climate vineyard could have grown this Pinot. It combines ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors with crispness and a delicate, silky mouthfeel. The end result is a dry, complex wine of considerable charm and a drink-me-again deliciousness.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kindred
US,"Very fruity, in fact superfruity, this wine attacks with ripe pie-filling raspberries, red cherries, pomegranates, cola and vanilla-cocoa flavors that flood the mouth, lasting through a long, spicy finish. All that fruit is balanced with crisp acids, while a touch of dusty tannins adds to the fullness. Drink now.",Reserve,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
US,"Sonoma Valley Cabernet specialist Cohn reaches to the Russian River to expand his portfolio with this Pinot Noir. It's not a stretch to call it Bordeaux-style. Although it has the variety's telltale silkiness and medium body, the blackberry, cola, coffee, leather and oak flavors, not to mention the tannins, possess density and gravity, which may make this wine ageable. Best now through 2011.",,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
US,"A nice bubbly that's mainly Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It shows Champagne flavors suggesting citrus fruits, pears, strawberries and bread, with crisp acidity making the finish clean. The mouthfeel is a little rough and scoury.",Vintage Brut,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"The flavors are pure and delicious, suggesting jasmine tea, strawberries, citrus fruits, rose-hip tea, smoky dough and cinnamon. Dry, clean and elegant; the mouthfeel could be a little smoother, though.",Brut Rosé,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"There's more than a little residual sugar in this soft, sensual Zin, but the wine handles its sweetness well. It's terrifically ripe in blackberry, mulberry, boysenberry and other rustic berry flavors, with lots of spices and vanilla. Drink now.",Baldoochi Old Vine,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ledson
US,"Tastes big, ripe and fruity, a wine that wants a little time in the cellar to calm down. Really swamps the palate with blackberry and cherry jam, currant, cola and mushu plum sauce flavors that go on and on. The tannins are thick and sweet. Hold until early 2011, then drink with a great steak, or a rich wild mushroom risotto.",My Father's Vineyard,93,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton Estate
US,"Good, but overly soft and simple, with a taste of melted cherry pie, cola and licorice. Needs greater structure and liveliness.",Rod's Pride,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Toad Hollow

US,"Heavy, with blackberry and blueberry jam and pepper flavors wrapped into strong tannins. It's a dry, well-ripened wine, but needs greater liveliness and complexity, especially at this price.",Allegria Vineyards Axiom,85,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"This block-grown Pinot from the estate vineyard, in the heart of the cool Green Valley, shows the signature Marimar style of tight acidity, dryness, silky elegance and red fruit. It's not a big, fat, blockbuster Pinot, but a leaner, more masculine style. The raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors should hold up well to the aging process. Now–2013, at least.",Earthquake Block Don Miguel Vineyard,93,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"The vineyard is in the cooler Green Valley, although you wouldn't know it from the label. The wine shows considerable crispness and dryness, with moderate alcohol. There are some tabasco and balsam notes grounding the richer cherry and sandalwood flavors. It's enormously elegant, a smooth, complex, silky Pinot Noir that should develop through the next six years.",La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"Grown at the highest part of the Green Valley estate vineyard, this Pinot is tight and concentrated in raspberry, cherry, cola and Indian spices, with a delightful mineralty and a rich coat of new oak.

US,"Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.",Bacigalupi Vineyards,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",Sonoma Reserve,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois

US,"Tastes bitter and raisiny, and the cola and cherry flavors are thin. Doesn't offer much richness.",Grand Reserve,82,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Villa Mt. Eden
US,"This is the best of the winery's new releases, both for drinking now and for cellaring. Combines power and elegance, with upscale flavors of cherries, currants, cola, rhubarbs, dried herbs and oak, wrapped into devastatingly rich tannins and a perfect touch of acidity. Should age well for 10 years.",Litton Estate Vineyard,98,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A joy to drink now, and will develop over a decade or more. A dry, pure, focused wine whose intricately detailed cherry, cola and cranberry flavors are enhanced by minerally things from the earth and a near-perfect application of oak. Changes by the second in the glass, ever fascinating.",Allen Vineyard,96,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A beautiful Syrah for drinking now with an elaborate steak or chop.

Feels fancy and detailed in the mouth.",,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard

US,Has extracted pineapple jam flavors and an oaky blanket that doesn't taste natural.,Reserve Selection,80,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hayman & Hill
US,"This is great Zinfandel. The vineyard was planted in 1915 and probably contains other varieties than Zinfandel. Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice. Has the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with smooth tannins and fine acidity. Zinfandel hardly gets any better than this.",Crow Ridge Vineyard,95,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,V. Sattui

US,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years.",Five Sisters,97,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Extraordinary for how drinkable it is right now, and for how it will evolve. Shows the crisp acidity and minerality of this cool-climate vineyard, with rich flavors of raspberries, cherry liqueur, cola, exotic spices, vanilla, buttered cinnamon toast and smoky sandalwood. Yet the tannic integrity should help it change in fascinating ways over the next six years. Decant for several hours.",Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard,95,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"So dry, so crisply acidic, so silky in the mouth, and so rich in flavor. This is a truly distinctive Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's elusive personality, now rich in cherries and currants, withdrawing into minerals and herbs. Yet the final impression is of fine, silky decadence. Should develop in fascinating directions over the next 6–8 years.",Buena Prierra Vineyard Helio Doro Block,95,90,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Brogan
US,"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California. Dazzles with tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with a brilliant overlay of oak that adds buttered toast and spice flavors, not to mention sturdy oak tannins. But it's the zesty acidity, like a squirt of lime juice, that really elevates this wine.",Ulises Valdez Vineyard,95,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paul Hobbs

Finishes a little sweet, but crisp.",Reserve,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Frei Brothers
US,"This is a wonderfully rich, seductive Pinot Noir. It has the lushness and complexity you want in a fine California bottling, with a silky texture and crisp acidity.

Lots of new oak, but it's perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Tina Marie Vineyard,94,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
US,"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

The vineyard is in the cool Green Valley.",Ruxtan Vineyard,94,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lost Canyon
US,"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style. It's flashy in complex tiers of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and cinnamon spice, yet is silky and dry. The fruit comes from Sonoma Coast, Green Valley and the Middle Reach. An impressive followup to the inaugural '07, and a bottling to watch.",Les Pommiers,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,EnRoute
US,"Here's a luscious, delicious Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's made in the modern style of soft ripeness, and features upfront cherry, cranberry, sweet fig and sandalwood flavors, with a tangy dusting of Indian spices. The acidity and tannins are near perfect. Drink now–2016.",Nicole's Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery

US,"Opulence, lushness and a silky, seductive texture are what you expect from Pinot Noir, and this one delivers them all. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with subtle, complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, red currants, licorice, bacon and peppery spices. Easy to drink from the get-go, and gets more interesting as it warms in the glass.",,93,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Of The Place
US,"Grown in the very cool central-southwestern part of the appellation, by Sebastopol, this Pinot features crisp, mouthwatering acidity. And, in this wonderfully long hangtime vintage, its flavors are extraordinarily rich and pure, brimming with cherries and raspberries. It shows layers of complexity, yet is too young, with the parts unintegrated. Give it 4–5 years in a cool cellar.",Jenkins Vineyard,93,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, although it's a bit brusque in acidity. Still, it's enormously rich and dry, with long-lasting flavors of raspberry tart and cherry-cinnamon granola. Give it a brief decant, and drink with rich, umami-inspired fare, like teriaki salmon or cured meats.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries.",Odyssey,83,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Enkidu
US,"Some off-notes mar this Pinot Noir. It smells a little vegetal, and then turns soft and fruity in the mouth, with flavors of cherries and cocoa.",Bluffs,83,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Not for the faint-hearted, this Zin is brawny and tannic, and high alcohol gives it a fierce burn. But it's fully dry, and has strong, deep flavors of dark forest berries, leather, tobacco and peppery spices. Now–2012.",Reserve,87,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"Way too high in alcohol, and distinctly Porty, with sweet raisin and cedar flavors, and a hot burn throughout.",Ponzo Vineyard,82,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ridge
US,"This is a barrel selection from J's various vineyards throughout the valley. It's drier, leaner and tarter than many other local bottlings, meaning the wine has an elegance that makes it enormously food friendly. Shows a lovely complex of raspberry and cherry tart and blueberry pie flavors, with the smoky, buttery crust. Drink now–2014.",Barrel 16,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Not quite as concentrated as the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but nearly so, and showing the signature dryness, acidity and overall classy mouthfeel. Beautiful and complex, with raspberry, cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb, rose petal and cola flavors that arevarietally correct. Drink now–2014.",Eastside Road Neighbors,93,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Another in a string of fine Pinots from this producer. Shows real cool coastal influence in the brisk acidity, delicate structure and deep flavors of cherries and cola, which seem to have a long hangtime complexity. Very good, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.",,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak.",,83,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Derbes
US,"The acidity and dryness on this Pinot stand out. It's not a blockbuster, but keeps its exuberance under tight control, offering tantalizing cherries, currants, cola and Indian spices, wrapped in a cloak of minerals. Very elegant, detailed and silky. Lovely now, with a good decant, and should develop complexity over the next 10 years.",Bucher Vineyard,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with strong, but not heavy, flavors of strawberries and raspberries. There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure.",Rose of Pinot Noir,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Lynmar
US,"Tough, hard and dry, with thick tannins and a cut of acidity that obscure deep flavors of blackberries, black licorice and black pepper. This chewy wine could develop over the next 2–3 years, but right now, it's pretty unrelieved.",Reserve,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frei Brothers
US,"Fruity and approachable, this is a Pinot Noir to drink now for its wealth of raspberries, cherries and milk chocolate. It's a smooth, silky wine that's a little candy-sweet on the finish.",,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"Good and complex, but smells a little candied, like mint cherry-scented toothpaste, and tastes sweetly jammy in cherries. This all-Pommard clone Pinot may be going through a mute phase. Try holding for several months.",Earthquake Block Don Miguel Vineyard,88,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"Beautiful and likeable for its dryness, crisp minerality, and the sleek, clean mouthfeel. The fruit suggests oak-inspired pears, oranges and citrons. This elegant quaff gets better as it warms in the glass. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"An O.K. everyday sipper, but otherwise there's not much going with this sweetly raisined Pinot Noir, which has some bitterness. Drink up.",River Road Ranch,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Trione
US,"An enjoyable off-dry wine, with sweetened flavors of peaches, vanilla, apricot, litchi and honeysuckle, finished with lots of Asian spices. Would benefit from crisper acidity, but it's a nice sipper at this price.",,85,12,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Adler Fels
US,"Pinot Noir doesn't get much richer than this smooth bottling from Fritz. It's their best yet, offering firm, drily crisp flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants and cola, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now.",,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fritz
US,"Shows the massively extracted raspberry, cherry, cola and anise flavors this block of the estate vineyard produces, with rich oak influences. No denying the opulence and immediately decadent appeal, or the silky, tapestry-like texture. Seems off a bit from the fabulous 2007, a little fatter, hotter and more obvious, but still a very flamboyant Pinot Noir. Drink now–2013.",Bliss Block,91,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"A wonderful Gewürz. You never know what to expect from this varietal, but in this case the wine is basically dry, and freshly crisp in acidity. The flavors are complex, ranging from oranges, pineapples and honeysuckle to star anise, toffee and the famous spices of Gewürztraminer. There's also a rich, creamy texture.",,91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Novy
US,"Made in an immediately appealing style, this Pinot has forward raspberry and strawberry jam, cherry pie, Dr. Pepper, vanilla custard and smoky sweet oak flavors. It's so delicious, you hardly notice the tannin and acid firmness. But that will protect it and enable it to age for 6–8 years.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Very rich, very ripe, showing the enormity of the vintage. With a coat of smoky oak, the wine erupts with fresh fruit flavors of pineapples, apricots, green apples, pears and spices, brightened with crisp, citrusy acidity. Delicious now, and should develop well for at least six years.",Ritchie Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex.",O.F.S.,95,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"A Syrah of considerable proportions, made in the Novy style of power and ripeness. It's suprising that Novy didn't priced it higher, as it has that extractive richness and inherent wealth of texture that are the domain of expensive red wines. Just tremendous in blackberries, chocolate and spices, with the most beautiful tannins. Drink now, with the finest meats.",Parsons' Vineyard,94,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Good Chardonnay, rich and ripe and steely. That metallic thing shows up both in the crisp acidity and in the stony, pebbly tang that adds a piquant freshness to the pineapple, lime tart, tangerine and smoky custard-cream flavors.",Estate Grown,94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"Made in a leaner, drier, lighter style than most Russian River Pinots, but the elegance and complexity are very attractive. Shows a white pepper and herbal note to the sour cherry candy fruit, and is balanced with perfect acidity. A beautiful wine to accompany, not overwhelm, fine foods. Production was an astounding 109,000 cases.",Estate Vineyards,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rodney Strong
US,"Made in the ultraripe style that is Williams Selyem Chardonnay, this wine almost needs to be enjoyed by itself as a cocktail. It's explosive in apricot jam, pineapple tart, pear crême brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that feel fat and dry and slightly hot in alcohol. Not particularly subtle, but earns points for sheer power.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there. It needs a year or so in the bottle to emerge, and even a brief decant will bring greater harmony to this expressively opulent wine.",La Sereinité,91,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"A bit weedy and thin in fruit, but not bad for the price. It's a dry, silky wine, with gentle flavors of cherries, mint, cola and sandalwood.",,84,13,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bogle
US,"A very elaborate Chardonnay showing flavors of exotic fruits, spices, buttered toast and cream. Charred oak and acidity currently dominate, making the wine a little rigid, but a year or two in bottle should soften and sweeten.",Ritchie Vineyard,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"Sweetly ripe and as soft as silk and velvet, this Pinot brings all the seductive attractiveness the variety is known for. A blend of different vineyards, the 30% new oak brings a balanced touch of smoky cedar and caramel to the wine's red cherry, root beer and red licorice flavors.",O.F.S.,89,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Spicy and very ripe, this polished Pinot bursts with pie-filling cherry and currant flavors, with interesting notes of tangerine rind, clove and orange pekoe tea. Could develop additional nuances with bottle age, but basically ready now.",Parsons' Vineyard,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"There are Russian River Pinot Noirs that are dark, heavy and dense, and then there are bottlings like this. It's a silky, light-hearted wine, easy and gentle in the mouth. At the same time, the flavors are complex, with waves of cherries, red currants, cola, pomegranates, mocha and an array of sweet Asian spices. Drink now.",Maboroshi Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Shows the firm acidity, elegant silkiness and richness of the southern part of Russian River Valley, where the grapes were grown. The cherry, cola, pomegranate, rhubarb, herb-mint tea and peppercorn flavors are complex, and finish with a tannic scour.",Inman Olivet Vineyard,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"With a funky note suggesting sweaty leather, this Pinot might be called Burgundian. It's dry and silky but complex, with a range of cherry pie filling, pomegranate, cola, tangerine zest, vanilla and smoky oak flavors. Best now.",Rod's Pride Goldie's Vines,87,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Toad Hollow
US,"A good, serviceable expression of a Russian River Pinot that's ready to drink now. Dry and crisp, it shows oak-infused flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and mocha.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Cuvée
US,"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple marmalade, lemon custard, vanilla and smoky meringue flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.9%.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Girard
US,"A very pretty, polished Pinot Noir, sourced from the cooler, foggier southern part of the valley, near River Road. Shows considerable acidity that stings the palate, but the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, enhanced with sweet oak, are very rich. Now–2013.",Ceremonial,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste. Floods the mouth with pineapple tart, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla flavors, with suggestions of kiwis, limes and green apples. Delicious and appealing.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"An okay red wine. It's soft, dry and common in structure, with thin flavors of blackberries, spices and a touch of oak.",,83,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Adler Fels
US,"This is Martin Ray's best non-reserve Chard in years. In fact, it's as good as some of their reserves. It shows real richness, with fancy oak and lees influences and complex the peach and pear fruit flavors.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"RRV doesn't get much fruitier than this. It explodes with black and red cherry, red currant, cola, sweet date, smoky vanilla and dusty Asian spice flavors. Despite all that power, the wine is silky and elegant. Delicious now, and should hold and improve for a number of years.",Graham Family Vineyard,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"A good, complex, full-bodied Syrah, with some toughness in the texture and a minty note that's less than ripe. Bigtime tannins and extreme dryness call for well-marbled beef to coax out its best.",Alegria Vineyard,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"Made in a lighter style, this wine is nonetheless rich and complex in flavor, proving that Pinot Noir doesn't have to be heavy to be really good. It's dry and spicy, with raspberry, cherry, red licorice and Dr. Pepper flavors. Drink now.",,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Paradise Ridge
US,"An extravagant Chardonnay, rich in buttered toast and vanilla cream from oak barrels, and opulent fruit flavors of ripe, sweet pineapples, golden mangoes and pears. The sur lie aging shows up in a creamy, yeasty richness. Holding this wine for a year or two will not harm it.",Quail Hill Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"More tannicly dense than Failla's estate Sonoma Coast bottling, this Pinot wants a few years in the cellar. You can drink it now because it's so delicious in cherry and raspberry fruit, but there's a tightness, an astringency that suggests 3-4 years to come around. If you pop the cork now, give it a few hours of decanting.",Keefer Ranch,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.",Zio Tony Ranch,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"Dry and crisp, but too feline in strong green aromas and flavors. A little of that goes a long way. Modest lemon and lime fruit comes to the rescue, but too little, too late.",Reserve,82,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Too green and acidic to earn a higher score, although it's pleasantly dry and clean, and there are some savory citrus flavors. But they're dominated by tart leafy tobacco and feline notes.",Reserve,82,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Frei Brothers
US,"A little soft and lacking in crisp vibrancy, but there's plenty of spearmint chewing gum, pineapple jam and golden mango flavors. The wine, which was unoaked, finishes a little sweet.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"A rich, direct Chard that leaves little to the imagination. It offers a sunburst of oak-inspired tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe and jammy, in the modern California style.",Orsi Vineyard,86,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,C. Donatiello
US,"This is a very fruity-rich Zinfandel. It pushes the envelope on power and almost goes over the top, but wisely stops short in favor of balance, with acids and tannins providing needed finishing structure. The flavors are big and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries, blackberries, plums and chocolate, not to mention huge spiciness. Perfect with short ribs of beef.",Papera Ranch Vineyard,90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy
US,"Vigorous and tannic, this young Pinot is hard right now. It also seems a little unbalanced, with some raisins and mint bracketing the cherries. Could just be going through an awkward youth. Try in 2011.",Graham Family Vineyard,87,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"This is a very pure, fresh and clean Chardonnay. While it's rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and smoky oak flavors, it's also well balanced. Shows brisk, citrusy acidity and a firm stream of minerals.",O.F.S.,92,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"As weighty as a Chardonnay, this is a Sauvignon Blanc whose nuances will be killed if you over-chill it. You could even decant it for a while and let it approach room temperature. Dry and rich, it shows savory, complex tiers of pineapples, limes, green apples, sweet golden tobacco, vanilla, white pepper and even a touch of thyme.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself. The vineyard, which is owned by the winery, is only 19 acres, planted to an array of newer and older clones. Best after 2013, if you can keep your hands off.",Litton Estate Vineyard,100,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Always one of Williams Selyem's top Pinot Noirs, the 2007 is a spectacular wine. The vines are the closest to the river in the famed Rochioli vineyard, and the resulting wine always has an elegant structure and fruity accessibility that make it drinkable at a younger age. Showing rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, bacon, anise, Asian spices and smoky oak, it will develop beautifully over the next decade.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,97,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",Allen Vineyard,97,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale. Yet it's superbly balanced with acidity, giving a refreshing balance to the intense apricot jam, lemon drop, candied ginger, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. A tremendous success for a California dessert wine.",Late Harvest,96,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Muscat,Williams Selyem
US,"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Forward and delicious, a vibrant wine that's fully drinkable now for the richness of fruit. Shows ripe waves of black and red cherries, raspberries, cola, chocolate and crème brûlée, leading to a long, sweetly spicy finish. Seems destined to be an early drinker, so best now and through 2012.",Bucher Vineyard,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Pretty tannic, with a hard edge, although it's very fruity and rich, and should soften and mellow with time in the cellar. Thoroughly dry, it shows complex flavors of wild raspberries, cherry compote, cola and spices, compounded with smoky, sweet oak. Give it until 2011 to begin to come around.",Peay Vineyard,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak.",Lorenzo Vineyard,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"Break out the hors d'oeuvres for this tart young Pinot Grigio. It needs food to balance it out. The acid-backed flavors are savory, and include Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass and sweet butter. Try with delicious little fish and pork appetizers baked in phyllo.",,87,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Grigio,Terlato
US,"Off a pace or two from the '05, but still shows plenty of ripe, fruity flavor. The jammy cherries and blackberries have rich notes of orange zest, licorice and smoky vanilla.",Estate,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Balletto
US,"Shows the fine varietal characteristics of dryness, silkiness and fruitiness you want in a nice Russian River Pinot, with suggestions of cherries, currants, root beer and smoky oak. There's also a streak of wintergreen tartness that seems to limit the cellar-worthiness. Best now and through 2010.",,86,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,C. Donatiello
US,"A little rough and scoury, but fine and crisp and clean, with a slight sweetness from the dosage enriching the citrus, apple, yeast and vanilla flavors. Fancy and elegant.",Brut Rosé,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years.",Papera Vineyard,94,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Swan's longtime winemaker, Rod Berglund, turns his Pinot-esque hand to Gewürztraminer with this well-crafted, aromatic young white wine.

US,"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit.",Reserve,85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Aggressive now in acidity, this Chardonnay has powerful sour Lifesaver candy flavors of pineapples and stony minerals, with a potent kick from smoky oak. It tastes young and jammy. It's elegant, and changes interestingly as it warms in the glass.",Ryo-fu,89,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla crème brûlée, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.",Ritchie Vineyard,94,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"Despite firm tannins and tough acidity this wine is so rich and silky, you can drink it now, with decanting. It floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, chocolate, anise, cinnamon spice and sweet oak. Absolutely delicious, with a silky, seductive mouthfeel. Although it's the least expensive of Williams Selyem's new releases, it's right up there.",Flax Vineyard,94,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A big, boldly powerful but elegant Zinfandel, full-bodied in the mouth and dry, offering waves of ripe fruits and spices. The cool 2007 vintage has kept the wine from being too ripe, resulting in balanced flavors of blackberries, currants, licorice, bacon, cocoa, black pepper and Asian spices. Just terrific. Drink over the next six years.",Forchini Vineyard,93,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Simi winemaker Steve Reeder has produced an utterly delicious wine with this barrel-fermented beauty, the best nonreserve Chard from the winery in nearly 10 years. It shows flamboyant, complex flavors of tropical fruits, green apples, pears, butterscotch and smoky vanilla, with crisp, clean Russian River acidity. This is a good price, and the wine should be easy to find, with nearly 20,000 cases produced.",,91,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Made entirely from the French Dijon clone 777, this is a very pure Pinot Noir that relies on flavor, rather than subtlely, for success. And there's no shortage of flavor. Cherries, raspberries, cola, vanilla, honey, smoky oak and spice flood the mouth, while the finish is dry and balanced. Good as it is, the challenge is to build in additional layers of depth and complexity.",The Farm Vineyards,91,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"There's a Floodgate Vineyard in Anderson Valley that produces very nice Pinot Noirs, but this one says it's from Russian River Valley. This wine is average in quality. It has a fine, silky mouthfeel, with some good cherry flavors, but also a sharp, green touch of mint that's unlikely to age out.",Floodgate Vineyard Old Vines,85,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,C. Donatiello

US,"Pretty good, but at this price, a bit heavy and over-extracted for a Pinot Noir, almost Grenache-like. The flavors are black peppery, with an underground stream of black cherries and oak, and the tannins close in on the finish.",Reserva,85,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Esterlina
US,"A very nice, elegant Pinot Noir. Shows clean crispness and pedigree, with fine acidity framing dry flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon and cola. A rich feel. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch,89,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is a very dry, silky Pinot Noir made in a more restrained manner than some of the big, huge ones out there. It doesn't whack your head, but appeals for its elegance. Shows sophisticated cherry, sassafras and sandalwood flavors, and the price is extremely good for the quality.",,90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pedroncelli
US,"Made in a leaner, crisper style than many Chards nowadays, this Chardonnay trades power for elegance. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrusy acids framing flavors of limes, pineapples and green apples that have a minerally edge. New French oak adds just the right touch of richness.",Calcaire,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"A pace off the 2005, this single-vineyard wine, from the Sebastopol area, shows enormously ripe, powerful flavors of cherries, blackberries, raspberries, cola and vanilla. Fortunately, acidity is quite high, giving all that rich flavor a crisp bite.",Hallberg Vineyard,90,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck

US,"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results. The wine is dry, silky and interesting, showing an array of cherry, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors. Has enough of a complex tannin structure to pair with lamb chops, or a great grilled salmon steak.",,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
US,"If there's any oak on this wine, it doesn't show. What does show up is crisply clean acidity and brilliantly ripe pineapple, lime and honeysuckle flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. It's a lovely cocktail sipper, and nice with bruschetta and olive or mushroom tapenade.",,88,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Angeline

US,"This is the driest, most elegant and balanced of Ottomino's new single-vineyard Zinfandels. It has a Cabernet-like structure, although the wild blackberry, mulberry, plum and exotic spice flavors are all Zin, as are the dense, sandpapery tannins. Good now with upscale rich beef and cheese dishes, and should develop gradually in the bottle for many years.",Von Weidlich Vineyard,92,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"Tons of jammy fruit in this softly tannic, easy-to-drink wine. Explodes with the essence of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mulberries and chocolate, with plenty of pepper and other Asian spices.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,86,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards

US,"A good, rich, village-style Pinot Noir with some real class, especially in the structure. The flavors of cola, cherries, red currants, licorice and cocoa are just fine, but it's the crispness and silky tannins that lift it up.",Heintz Ranch,89,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutch Bill Creek
US,"This is a big, strong, gutsy Syrah, a powerhouse of jammy blackberries, currants, bacon, pepper and sandalwood. It's completely dry, with rich, thick tannins and a long, spicy finish. Good now, with proper fare, and should glidepath through the next six years.",Guyzer Block,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Davis Family
US,"A beautiful, fine young Pinot Noir that shows off the WesMar style of crisp elegance at a lower price than their single-vineyard wines.

US,"Fans of big, soft, rich, high-alcohol Zins will rejoice with this epic bottling. The candied, pastry-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, plums, chocolate and red licorice are almost sweet, although the wine is probably dry, technically speaking.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,88,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,John Tyler
US,"A softly tannic and dry Zin. Offers wild berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors, with a meaty edge, like beef teriyaki. Easy to drink with a perfectly grilled steak.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast. Dazzles with a direct hit to the palate; is soft and dry. But it has a certain surface one dimensionality. Seems at its best now–2013.",Lindsay Estate Vineyard,88,85,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Paul Hobbs
US,"Dry and silky, a very proper Pinot Noir from this fine, cool vintage. It's marked in youth by brisk acids and forward, somewhat one-dimensional flavors of cherries, cola and spices, with the smoky sandalwood of barrel age. Could develop all kinds of surprises over the next 4–6 years.",Salzgeber Vineyard,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"If you like your Chards Burgundian style, you love the creamy complexity of this one.

US,"Tart acidity marks this wine, giving it a tingly palate feeling. But that could go away by summer 2010, when the wine will be fully available. Otherwise, it's silky and very good, with ripe black cherry, currant, cola, orange zest and sandalwood flavors. Now–2013.",,88,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
US,"Tannic and acidic now, with a bite-down mouthfeel, although the overall texture is nice and silky, and shows the elegance of Pinot Noir.

Drink now–2013.",Rancho Bello Vineyard,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"There's a flowery note to this Chardonnay, which is dry, crisply acidic and strong in flavor in its youth. Brims with pineapple tart filling, Key lime pie, orange zest, honeysuckle, daffodil and smoky, vanilla-oak flavors, with a creamy, yeasty richness. Would benefit from greater restraint and subtlety, which may come after 3–5 years in the bottle. If you drink it now, give it a good decanting.",La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard,90,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Tastes young and strong in primary fruit flavors—cherries, raspberries and spicy cola, accented with the caramel and vanilla of toasted oak.

It's a good, rich Chardonnay despite needing more subtlety and complexity.",Nagasawa Vineyard,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paradise Ridge
US,"Pretty rich and exotic for a Sauvignon Blanc, with tropical fruit and orange fruit flavors that might easily be Viognier. But it shows Sauvignon's zingy acidity, and finishes a little sweet. Easy to drink on its own.",Grandview Vineyard,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Paradise Ridge
US,"This is a big, powerful Zinfandel. It's very strong in blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and peppery spice flavors, and also very tannic and dry. A dramatic wine, it will do well with barbecue and heavily spiced beef dishes. Should develop bottle age through 2013 or so.",Ottomino Vineyard,89,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"A polished, elegant and delicious Pinot. New, smoky oak frames ripe, jammy blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and orange flavors, with richer notes of chocolate, figs and grilled meat.

US,"Failla has a great track record with this vineyard, which is source to many wineries. The '06 is fresh and vibrant, and needs a little time to develop. It shows classic balance, with rich tannins, crisp acidity and brilliantly ripe, oak-inspired flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola and currants. As delicious as it is now, it's nervous and tentative. Give it a few years to come around.",Keefer Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla

Might develop with a few years in the bottle.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Waits-Mast
US,"It's so easy to get a big Zin wrong, especially in a hot vintage like 2004, but Taft Street does a good juggling act with this single-vineyard Zin, made from century-old vines. The wine flirts with excessive sweetness, but pulls back at the last second, so that the blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors are essentially dry. Rich, fine tannins and brisk acidity help to provide balance.",Centennial Vines,88,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Taft Street
US,"Veteran winemaker Richard Arrowood has turned to this well-known vineyard for this Rhône blend of Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne.

US,"A lush Chardonnay marked by the integrated balance of all its parts, resulting in great harmony. It's very ripe in tropical fruits and quite oaky and leesy, but like the powerful gymnasts at Cirque du Soleil, all the performers work together as a troupe. Drink with rich, fancy fare, like lobster or scallops.",Dutton Ranch,92,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall

US,"Tastes grapey, with green table grape, pineapple, vanilla and spice flavors, and the finish is totally dry and crisp. It's a good, rich, savory wine, rather like a Pinot Gris, at a good price.",Old Vines,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Colombard,Y Rousseau
US,"A bit too tannic and acidic, with a hard edge that interferes with the palate's enjoyment of the pure, refined raspberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. A good, distinguished Pinot, but lacks voluptuousness due to the coarseness. Drink now.",,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"Rich and spicy, this lusty Zin shows how well the variety does in Russian River Valley. Aged in American oak, it's deep and long in cherry, cranberry, licorice, cola, cinnamon and paprika spice flavors. Best now, with rich meat dishes and hard cheeses.",,87,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto
US,"A very good Sauvignon Blanc, crisp in cool-climate acidity and clean in the mouth, with a scour of minerals. It's also very fruity, showing flashy flavors of tangerines, pineapples and peaches. Delicious as a cocktail sipper.",,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Fritz
US,"Delicious and complex now, offering upfront waves of raspberry tart, cherry pie with the crust, vanilla, toast, cinnamon and cocoa flavors. The acidity is just fine. A bit keen and juvenile, but could develop bottle nuance in a year or two.",,88,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Segue

US,"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.",Nugent Vineyard,86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"New oak dominates the aromas and flavors, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel overwhelming the underlying fruit, which suggests pineapples and green apples. Although the wine is dry and acidity is fine, the fruit lacks the richness to support the oak.",Reserve,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"A good wine that provides real Russian River Chardonnay character, at a decent price. Dry and crisp, it's made full Burgundy style, with vanilla and smoke accents to the pear, green apple and tropical fruit flavors.",,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Taft Street
US,"Good raspberry, cherry, orange tea, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors in this wine, brightened with crisp acidity and wrapped into a silky texture. Seems a bit simple and direct though. Probably best in the next few years. From Hop Kiln.",,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,HKG

US,"Marimar Torres frankly calls the planting of these 2 varieties in her estate vineyard, which had previously been to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, experimental. Much work needs to be done to perfect them. The wine, as it stands, is dry and acidic and one-dimensional in cherry and currant fruit. It requires greater levels of complexity and nuance.",Don Miguel Vineyard Syrah-Tempraillo,85,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Marimar Estate

Drink now–2013.",Gold Ridge,97,85,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Semper
US,"The taste is dominated by sweet vanilla and caramelly oak. Buried under that are tropical fruit, pear and kiwi flavors. While the acidity is nice and crisp, the wine is too oaky.",Reserve Selection,84,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Stunning and dramatic, reminiscent of a fine Burgundy. Hugely complex flavors of grilled tropical fruits, minerals, peaches and pears, elaborated with waves of smoky, honey-sweet oak and dusty spices. For all the richness, it's completely dry. A blend made from two of the greatest vineyards in the Russian River Valley.",Rochioli - Allen Vineyards,96,41,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell

US,"If this wine were drier and crisper it would be a lot finer. The flavors are very rich, suggesting ripe pineapple tart, Meyer lemon pie, vanilla and sweet butter.

US,"Actually from the Green Valley, a firm, young, minerally wine, with a flinty tang. There's also tremendous oak influence in the form of smoke, cream and butterscotch, but the richness comes from exotic Meyer lemon, Key lime pie and green apple jam fruit. Brilliant and compelling.",Cresta Ridge Vineyard,94,41,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell

US,"The vineyard is near Occidental, in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, and you can taste the fog and the sea and crisp nights in the acidity, like biting into a Gravenstein apple. Yet this perfect vintage has resulted in perfect fruit. It's hard to imagine richer blackberry, cherry and licorice flavors. Impeccable and impressive, but young. Best in the narrow window of 2011–2013.",MacLain's,94,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
US,"Too sweet, with jellied peach, pineapple and apricot flavors. Without the sugary taste this would be a really good Chard.",Hopkins Vineyard,83,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road

US,"No oak lets the basic wine show through, but the problem is that it's unbalanced. It's sugary sweet in peach and apricot flavors, with a harsh, burnt finish.",Unoaked,82,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mossback
US,"The influence of sur lie aging marks this wine, with an almost Champagne-like yeastiness. It's also quite oaky.

Don't drink too cold.",Starr Ridge Vineyard,93,41,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell

US,"Dry and focused in acids, the wine shows the balance and complexity of the vineyard, as well as its ageworthiness. It's very young now, with immature raspberry, cola, rum punch, balsamic, mushroom and Asian spice flavors, but decanting and slow warming in the glass help elevate it. Nonetheless, your best bet is the cellar. Best after 2008, and for many years after, depending on how old you like your wines.",Allen Vineyard,96,78,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A brilliant young Pinot that magically combines instant drinkability with ageworthiness. Silky and supple, the wine has broad, deep raspberry, cherry, cola, cocoa and spice flavors that are wrapped into sweet, fine tannins, leading to a long, complicated finish. Just gorgeous from the first sniff to the last sip, and should age well through 2015.",Flax Vineyard,96,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is always one of Williams Selyem's most complex, interesting wines. The ‘05 is especially layered, showing a silky, elegant mouthfeel that frames extraordinarily lush flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, root beer and dusty Asian spices.

US,"A dry, deeply flavorful and impressive Zinfandel that's still young at the age of three-plus years. Shows an immaculate structure of strong tannins and acids framing intense flavors of blackberries and plums, spiced with pepper and finished with the scour of espresso. Needs a little time, though. Give it 1–3 years.",Old Vine,92,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ledson
US,"Great structure marks this lush, young Pinot Noir. Crisp acidity and refined, firm tannins give it a solid framework, and the flavors are delicious.

Will age for up to a decade.",Rochioli Vineyard,92,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell

US,"This is a really good Zinfandel. It shows the exuberant, lusty quality of the variety, with wild blackberry, mulberry, tobacco and spice flavors that have a briary mouthfeel. But it brings a classic structure and elegance. Fine now, and the refined tannins suggest ageability through 2012.",Collins Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gary Farrell

US,"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",Allen Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A generous Chardonnay whose spicy taste leads to a crisp, dry finish. The wine is wonderfully ripe, showing pineapple, golden kiwi, Key lime pie and oaky vanilla flavors.",Ruxton,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"This single-vineyard Zin is a considerable improvement over the ‘04. The alcohol in the ‘05 is far lower, almost a full percent, yielding a more balanced and harmonious wine. But it's hardly shy. It's powerful in wild blackberry, cassis, raspberry, root beer, tangerine, chocolate and sweet thyme, while the tannic structure is rich enough to warrant bottle aging for a decade.",Forchini Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a good, dry and racy Chardonnay. It's not rich or particularly fruity, but it is elegant, with mineral-infused suggestions of citrus fruits brightened with a bite of acidity.",,85,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Of The Place
US,"One of the ripest of Hartford's new Pinots, this is a full-bodied and very rich wine. It offers extreme flavor in place of subtlety, offering a massive palate wash of blackberries and cherries that veers into Lifesaver candy. The bet is ageability. Hold until after 2011.",Jennifer's,91,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
US,"New toasty oak currently dominates, offering the butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel flavors that so many people think is the taste of Chardonnay, but is not. The true fruit stands out as pineapples and pears. It's a very clean, hedonistic wine to drink now with rich fare, like shellfish.",Lorenzo Vineyard,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"A well-made and complex Pinot Noir with sumptuous fruit and oak flavors, although the acidity and tannins are tough and warrant time in the cellar to calm down. It's bone dry, with rich cherries with the chewy skins, black raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet smoky cedar wood overtones. Give it at least through 2010.",Gunsalus Vineyard,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"There's a streak of green mint that cuts through the cherry and cola flavors, leaving behind a sharp hit of acid. Doesn't seem likely to develop with age, but good for its dry silkiness.",,85,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Derbes
US,"It's amazing how rich this is, given the pale, translucent ruby color. Waves of cherries, raspberries, roasted hazelnuts, cola, pomegranates, herb tea, dusty Asian spices and smoky oak change constantly in the glass, as the wine breathes and endlessly fascinates. Bone-dry and tartly crisp, the wine will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,95,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Dryness and acidity mark this terrific wine. It's one for connoisseurs, a Pinot that requires some understanding to fully appreciate, as it's not a hedonistic seducer. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a fruit-skin bitterness, and there are additional nuances of violets, cola, leather, balsam and smoky oak. This is certainly one for the cellar. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next eight years.",Allen Vineyard Hillside Blocks,94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Crisp and fruity, with lemon, lime, pineapple and spice flavors, brightened with mouth-cleansing acidity. Yet it's a bit too strong in those feline pyrazines that lend a green, unripe taste.",Ritchie Vineyard,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,De Loach
US,"Shows young vine jamminess, with fresh, ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. The Williams Selyem balance of acids and tannins of dry elegance is evident, as is the new oak. Complex and supple, this wine needs time in the bottle to show its best. Give it until 2008, and should drink well for years beyond.",Bucher Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Better than the ‘04, due to its greater structure, Bella Luna's ‘05 Pinot has complex acids and tannins. They provides the architecture for the extremely ripe cherry, raspberry and cola flavors that have been liberally aged in new oak. Best now in its flashy, seductive youth.",Bella Luna Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"Sprightly and delicious, with grapefruit, fig, Meyer lemon and apricot flavors made even brighter by vibrant acidity. This elegant SB will be delicious with a salad of bitter greens, figs, chèvre and grilled shrimp.",,91,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Fritz
US,"A beautiful young Pinot Noir that shows the elegance and limpid transparency of this great vintage. Wrapped into the silky texture are complex flavors of red cherry tart, spicy pomegranate, cola, vanilla, buttered cinnamon toast and smoky cedar. Fine now, and should remain interesting over the next four years.",Tina Marie Vineyard,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"Pretty soft for a Pinot Noir, and lacking the structural integrity the variety needs. Nonetheless, the flavors of black and red cherries, cola, orange zest and spices are delicious. Drink now.",,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rued
US,"This is the least successful of De Loach's otherwise brilliant new range of Zinfandels, for one simple reason: it's overripe. The alcohol is an astounding 16.5%, and the wine has flavors of raisins and prunes.",Butler Vineyard,84,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Defines a very ripe, varietally true interpretation of Zinfandel. It's the kind of wine the old Italian-American families might have enjoyed in days of old, with its lusty flavors of freshly picked wild berries that were made into jam. The alcohol is on the high side, but the wine is luscious.",E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gia Domella
US,"Good, but a little lacking in depth and richness. The cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors are compromised by thinner notes of wintergreen and even a veggie touch.",,85,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"A tasty, simple and rather sweet wine. It has fruit juice flavors of pineapples, mangoes, apricots and peaches.",The Angel's Fare Saralee's Vineyard,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Lionheart
US,"Somewhat simple and oaky, this Chard has green apple, pineapple cookie, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. It's a pretty wine made for drinking now.",Estate Grown,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanna
US,"Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"Rich and appealing, a new bottling from the winery. All the parts have yet to knit together, but they're all good, and the wine should drink well by winter 2007. New oak frames tart green apple, pineapple, kumquat and cinnamon spice flavors that are heightened by bright, zesty acidity.",Emelia's Cuvée,90,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Made from Musque clone, and completely barrel fermented with sur lie aging in partial new oak, this is a good wine that can't quite overcome its feline character. Minor feline essence notes in a symphony of lemongrass, pineapple, fig and honeydew.",,87,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Merry Edwards
US,"Minty and green, a hard, acidic wine only somewhat relieved by cherry and oak flavors. Not bad, but pretty lean.",,83,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Angeline
US,"Ripeness was not a problem with this wine, which is fat and unctuous. It shows complex apricot, mineral, pear, green apple and lees flavors that finish with a glyceriney taste of honey. Should develop for a few years in the bottle.",Heintz Vineyard,90,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Simple, sweet and sour, with apricot and orange marmalade flavors. A blend of Merlot, Carignan, Syrah, Cab and Petite Sirah.",Betsy's Backacher,81,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Spann Vineyards
US,"Too sweet by far, with a white sugary finish to the pineapple and pear flavors. Crisp acidity helps to provide a framework of balance, but the sweetness really feeds into the perception that California white wines have residual sugar.",,80,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Arger-Martucci
US,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",Don Miguel Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"This is a very concentrated and intense young Sauvignon Blanc. With 43% new oak, it shows a rich creaminess riding over the laser-like gooseberry, grapefruit and lime flavors. It's also extremely crisp in acidity, since malolactic fermentation was entirely prevented.",La  Petite Etoile Vineyard,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Awkward and rustic. Although it's entirely dry, it has a sweet, pastry-filling cherry taste, with an edge of raisins. And the texture is sharp and green.",,82,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Romililly
US,"A glorious success, for this or any vintage. It shows classic Russian River balance and refinement, with exquisitely ripe berry and stone fruit flavors counterbalanced with earthier mushroom and funky leather notes. The acids, tannins and silky mouthfeel are textbook Pinot. Best now–2012.",Olivet Lane,94,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A blend of Marsanne and Roussanne, this Rhone white blend offers explosive flavors of baked peaches, pears and spicy mangoes, with even richer, more exotic nuances of litchi, butterscotch, toasted marshmallow, vanilla bean and coconut macaroon.  As this description suggests, it's a big wine, but it's dry and balanced.",Saralee's Vineyard,89,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Luko
US,"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,89,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Straddles the line between dry and off-dry, and veers into the latter. Shows sweet flavors of citrus fruits, vanilla and meringue, like a pastry. Good, but palls after a few sips.",,83,11,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Kenwood
US,"Soft, ripe and thick, this is one of those Rhône-style Pinots that purists will find on the big side for a variety that's supposed to be silky and delicate. On the plus side, it's a dry, rich wine, with oodles of cherries, blackberries and cinnamon-spiced punch.",Tara Vineyard,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Russian Hill
US,"The vineyard is in Fulton, a cool part of the southeastern valley heavily influenced by fog, and the vines are about 100 years old. This is great, classic Zinfandel. It should be in a museum. Despite high alcohol, it has a silky, Pinot-esque suppleness, balanced with crisp acids, and is profoundly rich in Zinny flavor. Currants, mushu plum sauce, anise, crushed black pepper, dark chocolate and rich Asian spices last forever on the finish.",Highwire Vineyard,96,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hartford
US,"Made in the Merry Edwards style, which is powerfully ripe and extracted, yet always balanced. Dazzles with enormous cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, beef jerky, raspberry tart, anise, pepper and smoky cedar flavors that finish with amazing length. Yet the tannin-acid structure is superb, and the wine is totally dry. Beautiful now, and should age through 2012.",Klopp Ranch,96,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"The vineyard was made famous by Williams Selyem for fantastically rich, ageable Pinot Noirs. Now Merry Edwards has her own bottling, and it's right up there. Tastes young and grape-sappy, with jammy black cherry, cola, licorice and dusty Asian spice flavors, perfectly accented with smoky new oak. Needs time, and will develop complexities through 2012, at least.",Flax Vineyard,95,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"The winery's most expensive wine comes from very low-yielding Martini selection grapes planted in 1975. The '07, tasted at a bit more than one year of age, was pronounced in smoky oak and robust tannins, showing jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise, cloves and cedar. Hold this powerful wine until 2011.",Arrendell Vineyard,95,85,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"Super-rich, a fat, opulent Chard that tastes almost as sweet as a dessert, except it's dry. Shows massive flavors of Meyer lemon custard, minerals, pear tart, buttered toast, butterscotch, smoky pie crust and honey, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Lush and gorgeous.",Allen Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.",Heintz Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"A beautiful, polished Pinot Noir that offers loads of flavor, while preserving the vital acidity that keeps the wine fresh and balanced. Cherries, raspberries, root beer, vanilla, cinnamon and smoky sandalwood flood the mouth, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now through 2013.",Dutton Ranch,94,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Always a dense wine in youth, Keefer is an ager, and winemaker Ehren Jordan has captured its essence with this impressive young wine. Shows classic Russian River structure, with firm acids and a dusting of tannins that frame vibrant flavors of cherry, rhubarb, red currant, cola, pomegranate and cedar. Delicious and compelling, this wine will evolve for up to six years.",Keefer Ranch,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"For many wineries, this would be their top Pinot. For Rochioli, it's their basic bottling. Shows ripe cherry pie, root beer, cola, tea, spice and what Michael Broadbent used to call beetroot flavors, yet is delicate and silky, almost weightless. Drink this yummy wine now.",,93,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",Dutton Ranch Kylie's Cuvée,93,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"This is a very sweet, unctuous dessert wine, with the flavor and texture of honey. Made from Viognier, it has decadent apricot, peach, tangerine and crème brûlée notes that combine in a dense, delicious mélange.",Oley Dessert Wine,93,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
US,"Too oaky, with dominating caramel and smoke flavors, and also very sharp. There's a citrusy bite of acidity that detracts. Finally, the wine ends on an overripe, Porty note.",Windacre,80,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Merriam
US,"Great Zin. It's robust and brawny, in the way of Zin, with the rustic wild berry, nettle, chamomile and spice flavors you expect from the variety, but shows good control in the smooth tannins and modulated alcohol. Picks up extra points for sheer deliciousness.",Eight Cousins Vineyard,89,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pellegrini
US,"The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the acidity is very high, giving a bright purity to the kiwi, Key lime pie, pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors. Lots of toasty new French oak and lees bring super creaminess to the mouthfeel. White Burgundy is the model, expressed California-style.",Keefer Ranch,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Armida
US,"Bob Cabral has crafted a wine that combines purity of fruit with power and silky elegance. The wine explodes with baked apricot, nectarine and guava flavors, the kind of fruit filling that oozes out of a buttery tart fresh from the oven. Yet bright acidity balances it out. Oak adds the perfect touch of vanilla and marzipan.",,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"This isn't one of those rich, gooey Chardonnays that dazzle some people. But it's a crisp, minerally wine that shows great elegance and Chablis-like sophistication. Dry and crisp, it shows complex flavors of tart green apples and pears, with subtle influences of smoky oak.",Estate Bottled,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"This is Merry Edwards' personal vineyard, and as the vines gain age, the wines get better and better. The 2006 is young and grapey and needs time in the cellar to come around. It's a powerhouse of a wine, stuffed with black and red cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors. Impresses for the sheer depth of flavor and overall balance. Best after 2010, if you can keep your hands off it.",Meredith Estate,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A blend of several vineyards located near the winery, in the valley's famed Middle Reach, this is the biggest and richest of Williams Selyem's Spring 2007 releases. Full-bodied and soft, it shows ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, plums, sweet rhubarb, cola and sandalwood. Beautiful now and through 2013.",Westside Road Neighbors,93,67,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Shows the plush ripeness of this vintage, offering a blast of cherry, raspberry, currant, mocha, licorice and smoky cedar flavors. Yet the balance is just fine, with crisp coastal acidity and richly textured tannins. Drink early for its youthful pleasures.",Bohemian Vineyard,93,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
US,"This is a seriously good Pinot. It's easy to imagine drinking it at a great restaurant, with a fabulous steak. The tannin-acid structure is just perfect, and the texture is silky. Yet tasted at the age 18 months, it's a bit heavy in jammy cherries and raspberries, which suggests aging. Try holding off until 2011–2015.",Toboni Vineyard,93,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. The texture is right down the middle between silky-light and full-bodied. Beautiful now and through 2012.",Salzgeber Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"The fine vineyard expresses itself in the ripe flavors and textural balance of this Pinot Noir. It shows flavors of baked cherries, red currants and cola, with smoky pie crust notes from oak. A bit tight and aloof, so give it a good decant. Now–2012.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,89,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonnet
US,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014.",Meredith Estate,97,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dense and intricately constructed, this Pinot Noir always is a big, rich fruity wine. The 2007 is perhaps emblematic of the vineyard, showing massive flavors of cherries, blueberries and wilder, foxier berries that have an exotic note. The tannins are thick, and the wine is entirely dry. Very fine, a chef's dream to pair with perfectly matched food. Fine now, with a few hours of decanting, and should develop through 2013, at least.",Klopp Ranch,94,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is a restaurant wine. It's really fancy, really good and really food-friendly. Although it's rich in fruit and oak, it possesses an underlying tension, with acidity and tannins all vying for center stage. You're always looking for the center of gravity. In other words, a wine of great complexity and interest. Now–2013.",Estate Grown,94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level. Barrel fermented in 80% new oak, aged on the lees and put through full malolactic fermentation, it's rich, creamy, buttery and exotically flavored in opulent toasted barrel and tropical fruits. I personally like this style, but others might find it too oaky.",Winemaker's Reserve,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Château Souverain
US,"Another successful Pinot, similar to the '04— may be a bit crisper and more elegant, but with the same lovely cola, cherry, strawberry, root beer, dusty spice and vanilla-oak flavors. Probably offering its most exuberant side now and for a year or two.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pellegrini
US,"No winery has associated itself more with Petite Sirah than Foppiano. That understanding shows in this wine, which wrestles the variety's rustically wild nature into something resembling submission. Still, it retains its dry, tannic edge, with all sorts of forest berry and herb flavors. Will live for many years, gradually softening.",Estate,88,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Foppiano
US,"Nice and ripe in black cherry pie filling, black raspberry, cola, root beer and smoky oak flavors, this Pinot has some firm tannins that will stand up to a rich steak. It should hold through 2010.",Castelli-Knight Ranch Vineyard,91,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armida
US,"The grapes seem like they were picked earlier than others, making for a lean-style Pinot Noir that's high in acids and minerality. It's almost austere, although maybe “restrained” is a better word. Dry and tannic, but with a deep core of cherry compote fruit, the wine needs a little time. Should begin to blossom by 2007 and drink well through 2012.",Hailey's Block,91,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
US,"If you're a fan of big, oaky Chards, you'll like this one. It's rich and unctuous in ripe tropical fruit custard flavors, with the buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky char that comes from new French barrels. But it has a perky acidity that lends it an appley, minerally note.",Floral Clone,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Godwin
US,"Easily the best Martin Ray Pinot in memory, this wine has hidden depths, and is absolutely delicious right now. It's pale in color, even a little brown at the edge, yet explodes in the mouth with fresh, vibrant cherry pie filling, rhubarb tea, cola and cinnamon flavors. Despite the power, the texture is delicate and silky.",Reserve,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,93,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Affaire de Coeur
US,"Here's a big, rich, full-bodied Zin that calls for equally big foods, like tri-tip, barbecued ribs and Szechuan-style beef. Although it's extremely dry, it's fruity, with flavors of blackberries, mulberries and plums, accented with spices, sassafras and grilled meat.",Feeney Vineyard,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This Pinot Noir balances its extraordinary richness with a silky texture, crisp acidity and a dry, tangy minerality. The immediate impression is of fruit: cherries, raspberries and milk chocolate. Yet the finish is brisk and clean. Irresistably drinkable.",Third Alarm Reserve,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"Similar to the excellent 2005, this bottling needs some time in the cellar to let the fruit, tannins, acids and oak knit together. Tasted in early winter of 2009, it's fresh and dramatic, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, licorice, orange zest and cedar. Try toward 2010.",Tobias Glen,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Owner/winemaker Oded Shakked was until recently the longtime winemaker at J Wine Co. Now he's doing his own thing, and this is his personal vineyard, in prime Pinot Noir country along Westside Road. The wine is softly opulent in blueberry, blackberry and coffee flavors, with a melted chocolate richness balanced by rich, ripe tannins. Drink now.",Dakine Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"A dry, and elegant fruit-forward wine. It was harvested relatively early, at lower brix, resulting in crisp acidity and succulent flavors of tart green apples and kiwis, with a tang of pepper and cinnamon. Delicious.",Unoaked,88,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"The vineyard, in a warmer part of the valley, is old, but the wine has intense, youthfully jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries and blueberries, with Zin's great edge of peppery spice. It's a big, audacious wine, but never loses poise despite very high alcohol.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Arrowood's Saralee's always is balanced and dry, but quality varies by vintage. The '03 is a very good wine, rich in licorice-accented cassis and pepper flavors, with a generous coating of smoky oak. It's not a big wine, or ageable, but it does have grace and elegance now and for a year or two.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Arrowood
US,"A beautifully complex and sophisticated wine, showing lush flavors of red cherry pie filling, cranberry tart, Dr. Pepper and cedar. Finishes rich and butterscotchy, but thoroughly dry, with a crisp tang of citrusy acidity. Now through 2012.",,92,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A luscious Pinot Noir, dark and rich in blackberry, cherry, cola, cocoa, cedar and spice flavors. It's big and powerful now in fruit, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",Mononi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"The vineyard is in the warmest corner of the valley, almost into Dry Creek, and the wine in its youth is a bit heavy. But it's quite rich and complex, showing flavors of currants, mocha, espresso, oranges, cola and peppery spice. Nice now, with a good steak, and could easily develop over the next 8 years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,56,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Beautiful now, with a lovely texture and delicious flavors, this could even benefit from a couple years in the cellar. The vineyard is very fine, and Lost Canyon has a good track record with it. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries, licorice, cola and spice are ever shifting, making you want to try a second, third, fourth sip. Best now–2009, before it loses vitality.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Drinkable now, but has the structure for the cellar. Grown in a Forestville vineyard from modern Dijon clones, it's very fruity, offering clean, pure flavors of cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. The cool climate contributes fresh, zesty acidity, but the tannins are considerable. Beautiful now with decanting, and should develop through 2013.",Tobias Glen,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"New oak dominates this young wine, with vanilla-accented buttered toast and smoky aromas. Underneath the wood are strong, complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, licorice, cola and Asian spices. With fine tannins and acidity, it seems to be a natural for the cellar. Hold until after 2011.",Flax Vineyard,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Pretty expensive for a rosé, but it's a seriously good, crisp wine from a premier Pinot producer. It features elegant strawberry, rose petal, tea and dried herb flavors that change with every sip. A dash of Syrah seems to add body and richness.",Vin Gris of Pinot Noir,90,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Here's one of the bigger, more dramatic Russian River Pinots of the vintage. Dark, medium- to full-bodied and fairly tannic, the wine needs time to throw off some weight and reveal its pretty cherry fruit. Hold until 2008; should drink well through 2012.",Dutton Ranch Sanchietti Vineyard,90,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Achieves the alchemy of well-toasted oak and perfectly ripe fruit to produce this luscious, creamy Chardonnay. Mangoes, papayas, pineapple custard, caramel, vanilla, it's all there, along with crisp, balancing acidity.",Reserve,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"While this Zin is clinically dry, it's so explosive in cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate and cola flavors that it's almost sweet, like pie filling. The acids and tannins rush in at the last minute, balancing it with a dusty dryness. It's a classically ripe coastal Zin, and savvy sommeliers will have fun figuring out what to pair it with.",Feeney Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"This isn't a cheap wine, but it's a good value compared to more costly Russian River Pinots. It's classy, showing Pinot's silky elegance with delicious cherry, cola and tea flavors. Hard to imagine a more versatile Pinot; will go with everything from salmon to steak.",,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alderbrook
US,"Made in a softly flamboyant style, with massive flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème brûlée, firmed with stony minerals. Tons of stuffing in this opulent Chardonnay, which was aged in 50% new oak.",Highlands Estates Piner Hills,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is quite a good Pinot Noir, and one to drink now for its silky deliciousness. It flatters the palate with ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper. Hard to imagine anyone not liking it a lot.",Coster Vineyard,91,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vision Cellars
US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.",Tré Terre,91,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"There's a deep, ultraripe core of cherry and blackberry fruit to this wine that's almost shriveled. You can sense that hint of raisins in the finish, which is very dry and on the astringently tannic side. It's a nicely fashionable wine, but not an ager, so drink now.",Ellen's Block,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Russian Hill
US,"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality. Give it until mid-2008, and for a couple years after.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",Coopersmith,92,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dramatic in depth and structure, a cool-climate Syrah that will benefit from some time in the cellar. Deeply saturated in color, bone dry and full bodied, it offers ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, with plenty of black pepper and sweet, chewy leather. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",Fiorella,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",Tré Terre,87,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"There's something exuberantly old-fashioned about this Pinot. It's dark, dry and tannicly rustic, with huge, gobby, fresh cherry pie flavors deep inside. Swan Pinots last for a long time; give this one five years to soften and melt those tannins.",Trenton Estate,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This refreshing wine has that extra something that pushes it to the next level. Shows deliciously ripe lime, lemon and sweet grass flavors that show little oak influence, letting the fruit and spice shine. Without malo, the wine is sprightly in mouth-cleansing acidity.",,89,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Longboard
US,"This is a cool-climate wine made in a good vintage. It's very dry and rich in acidity and tannins, but well-ripened grapes have yielded deep flavors of blackberry jam, blueberries and pepper, with a savory edge of grilled meat. This balanced, powerful Syrah will evolve over the next six years.",Cherry Ridge Vineyard,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Quite pale for a Pinot Noir, and with a lilting, delicately silky mouthfeel. But there's nothing light about the flavors, which are intricate as a tapestry. The cherries, raspberries, orange peel and vanilla have an herbal edge of rosehip tea and rhubarb pie. Now through 2012.",,91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"This unoaked Chard is bright and exuberant in ripe green fruits, such as Granny Smith apples, kiwis, limes, table grapes and mangoes. Acidity in this cool vintage is very high, and when I tasted it, it still had some fizzy fermentation. Technically this is a flaw, but it didn't interefere with my enjoyment.",Acero Don Miguel Vineyard,87,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Tastes of new oak and is also acidic, a combo that makes the mouthfeel rather harsh and salty, despite obviously well-ripened fruit. May settle down and show softer, lusher notes in a year or so.",Dominique,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Shows the balance and harmony of RRV Pinot, at a fair price. Dry and silky, bursting with cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate and cinnamon spice flavors that are enriched with sweet vanilla from oak barrels. Easy to find, with more than 17,000 cases produced.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"This is one of your bigger, fatter, riper Russian River Pinots, with jammy, oak-accented cherry, raspberry, root beer and vanilla flavors that are very forward and lush. The wine is extremely soft, though, and could certainly use a boost of acidity for balance. Still, it sure is tasty. Drink now.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonnet
US,"Jacaman's been doing a good job with their Russian River Pinot. This one's a bit off the pace of the '03, due to the hotter vintage that makes the wine riper and simpler. But it's still a flavorful, dry, silky wine, with a fair degree of complexity. Drink now.",,87,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
US,"World-famous Rochioli doesn't want to use their own Cabernet grapes, so they sell them to former J Wine Co. winemaker Oded Shakked, who carefully crafts this dry, full-bodied 100% Cabernet. It's young, acidic and tannic, but with its polished core of cherries, should ease well into the next decade.",Rochioli Vineyard,88,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, showing flamboyantly ripe cherry, raspberry and chocolate-cola fruit, spiced with cinnamon and anise and enhanced with smoky oak. Fortunately, all this richness is framed in a fine structure of acidity and tannins. Drink now through 2012.",Estate Grown,91,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
US,"Soft and gentle, yet firm in tannins, this Zin has an interesting dried herb and molasses edge to the blackberries, cherries and peppery spices. It's full-bodied, dry and complex, a wine to pair with beef dishes.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Very ripe and fruity-spicy, almost like a Zinfandel except for the silkiness, this Pinot shows flavors of black cherry pie filling, red currants and pomegranates, with earthier notes of cola and sweet tobacco. It's a bone dry wine whose thick tannins suggest modest ageability. Now through 2012.",Dutton Ranch,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Crisp and silky, this is a pretty Pinot Noir to drink now. It offers a wealth of cherry, cola, anise, sandalwood, cinnamon and pepper flavors that finish dry and complex.",,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"It's all there in this Chardonnay, with barrel influences of butterscotch and toast, crisp Russian River acidity, and ripe flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples. Feels a bit sharp, so don't over-chill, and you can even give it a decant.",,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bourassa Vineyards
US,"Ultradry and tart in acidity, this is not a Chardonnay for those looking for richness. With citrus and mineral flavors, it's suggestive of a young, minor Chablis. Clean and vibrant. Drink now.",River Road Ranch,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Trione
US,"Almost sweet in pineapple custard, marzipan and butterscotch flavors, and there may even be a bit of residual sugar in this honey-rich Chard. Saved by a crisp backbone of acidity.",OFS,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Good everyday Chard, with direct flavors of pineapples and kiwis, and the buttercream and smoky vanillins that oak barrels contribute. Finishes dry and crisp.",,86,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Polished and fruity, with ripe peach custard, nectarine, pear and spicy green apple flavors enriched with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Crisp acidity makes the wine racy.",,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hook & Ladder
US,"Darker and meatier than the winery's basic Sonoma County bottling, this Pinot has a fleshy fullness and tannins that suggest midterm aging. It's very dry and a bit soft, with powerful black cherry, cola, rhubarb, coffee and leather flavors.",,89,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Feels a bit heavy now, with direct flavors, like cherry and chocolate cream pie filling without the crust. However, there are suggestions that aging will benefit. The tannins are thick, and the acidity is good enough to carry the wine through some evolution. Try after 2011.",Longbow,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This is a big, oaky, creamy Chardonnay, but it retains the crisp acidity and overall control to be balanced and even elegant despite its size. Shows potent flavors of pineapple-infused crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla custard. Drink now.",Winemaker's Reserve,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Souverain
US,"Bright and zesty, with flavors of limes, kiwi fruit, green apples and pineapples, accompanied by crisp acidity. Could almost be an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Oak plays only a supporting role.",,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jordan
US,"The options for fine, really dry California Gewürz are surprisingly limited, which is too bad, because a good one, like Halleck's '06, is hard to beat. Racy and crisp in acidity, it's bright in flavor, offering waves of peaches, apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, figs, vanilla and the complex Asian spices from which the variety takes its name.",Piner Creek Ranch Dry,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Halleck
US,"A fruity Pinot Noir, with delicious flavors of raspberry tart, Cocoa Puffs and vanilla cream. Feels a little too soft and melted for the cellar, but it's a sophisticated, dry wine that will pair nicely with steak.",Tina Marie Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett
US,"A bit on the hot, unbalanced side. Despite dryness, ripe cherry pie, cola, cinnamon and sweet vanilla flavors and a gentle, silky texture, there's some burn, and not a lot of depth. Drink now.",Maboroshi Vineyard,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Richer and tarter than Kenwood's regular '05 Chard, this wine shows the acidity and green apple flavors of the central part of the valley. Bosc pears, Meyer lemons and white peaches pleasantly complicate things as you continue to sip.",Reserve,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood
US,"Lovely, a Pinot that doesn't slap you silly with extract, just flatters with sensuous pleasure. It's a light-colored wine, with a delicately silky texture framing cherry, cranberry, cola and tea flavors, and is quite dry. Easy to find, with 12,000 cases produced.",,88,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rodney Strong
US,"Angeline is one of the best second labels in California, in this case from Martin Ray. This '08 Sauvignon smacks of ripe, tangy Asian pear, gooseberry, fig, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors brightened by wonderfully crisp acidity. Just beautiful, and a nice bargain at this price.",,90,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Angeline
US,"Acidity marks this Chardonnay. It gives a tart, mouth-cleansing citrusy scour to the lemon and lime and pineapple flavors that finish so dry. It's a minimalist wine, with a minerally frame, and quite good with shellfish.",Estate Bottled,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fog Crest
US,"Lots of plush, ripe sour cherry, currant, cola and pomegranate flavors in this dry, silky wine, but also lots of tannins. Like chewing on a grape skin, with the resulting astringency. Needs time. Better after 2010.",Hallberg Vineyard,90,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.",,90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Of The Place
US,"A bit soft and semisweet, this seems to be the victim of an overly hot vintage. It has candied flavors of cherry and blackberry jam and, while a pleasant sipper, isn't really very interesting, although it does show Pinotesque silkiness.",Don Miguel Vineyard,85,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"Soft and superripe, although dry, this Pinot certainly floods the mouth with attractively creamy crushed berry, cola, tea and spice flavors. But it's not particularly complex and falls apart on the finish. Drink now.",Estate Vineyards,85,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Russian Hill
US,"Sharp and candied, with Lifesaver sweet-and-sour cherries and cola softened with smoky wood notes. The tannins are sandpapery and firm. Drink now with rich beef and lamb.",Nunes Vineyard,87,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"This is a blend of vineyards from which the winery sources its fruit. It's a very good wine, dry and crisp, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, root beer and herbs. The texture is silky, the balance impeccable, but it's a tad thin in the midpalate.",Westside Road Neighbors,88,62,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is the least expensive of Barnett's new single-vineyard Pinots, but it's also the richest and tastiest. It's a luscious wine, filling the mouth with cherry, currant, cola, sassafras or root beer, vanilla and anise flavors, wrapped into a silky texture. Feels luxurious and fine. Drink now through 2013.",Tina Marie Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett
US,"A really nice Sauvignon Blanc. Fundamentally dry, but rich in fruity extract, it shows crisp, creamy flavors of pineapples, limes, sweet Meyer lemons, vanilla and smoky oak, girded by a firm minerality. Shows how well the cool Russian River Valley can treat this variety.",,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Ledson
US,"A bit on the simple side, but likeable for its cherry pie filling, blackberry jam, cola and spicy coffee fruit that fill the mouth with flavor. Thoroughly dry, the wine is elegantly smooth and balanced. Drink now.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"Here's a crisp, dry, young Sauvignon Blanc, with a little cat pee, but fortunately it's drowned in a flood of grapefruit, lime, passionfruit and fig flavors. Crisp acidity scours the palate and gets those tastebuds whistling.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
US,"Alderbrook's winemaker could have made a big, fruity wine in this warm vintage, but seems to have decided to make a more delicate, higher-acid Chard instead. This food-friendly sipper has nice peach, apple and pineapple flavors, and is balanced, dry and elegant.",,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Alderbrook
US,"This is a polished, pretty wine of great power. It displays a dazzling array of red and black cherry, raspberry, currant and licorice flavors, tinged with mocha and cedar. Has a certain young vine freshness. Mid-term cellaring for a couple years will help it knit together.",Coopersmith,89,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, lightly delicate and elegantly silky, yet with powerhouse flavors that impress. Floods the palate with wild red cherry, cola, sandalwood and cinnamon spice flavors, excited with clean acidity. Drink now.",Reserve,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"A very lush, fruity wine, if a bit soft, with flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. Satisfies for its richness and creamy texture.",Four Hearts Vineyards,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"A market glut of Pinot Noir grapes and wine is resulting in more vintners offering the variety as a blush. Consumers are the beneficiaries. This delightful wine is delicate, silky and dry, with tangy acids framing subtle strawberries and cream flavors.",Pinot Noir Rosé,86,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"A nice example of the '08 Pinots, just coming out, and the price is fair for a wine of this quality. Dry and silky, it shows good varietal flavors of cherries, cola, chocolate, sweet pomegranates and smoky oak, with a long, rich finish. Drink now.",Estate Bottled,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"Although there's lots to like in this Zin, it's just too sweet. On the plus side are rich, complex flavors of cherry pie, raspberry tart, cassis, cocoa and mushu plum sauce, accented by peppery spices and a bit of wood. Also nice are the dense but ripe tannins. But then there's that sugary, brownie taste that's inappropriate in a table wine.",,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"There's enough unripe fruity flavor in this wine to detract from its pleasure. As dry, crisp and silky as it is, its cherry and cola flavors are marred by a sharp, green taste of menthol.",,84,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
US,"Very ripe and lush, this Pinot shows deep flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla fudge, mint, cinnamon, nutmeg and sandalwood. It's at its silky, exotic best now and for a few more years.",Nugent Vineyard,89,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"A lovely, bright and crisp wine that does a great job of cleaning the palate. With brisk acidity, it shows tangy flavors of limes, passionfruit and pepper spice.",,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
US,"Superripe in cherries, red currants, persimmons and cola, this single-vineyard Pinot has a lightly silky texture, with the crisp acidity that Russian River terroir lends. It's a delicious wine to be drinking now and for a year or so.",Widdoes Vineyard,88,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"A bit brittle, with big acidity and a tension of green fruit and cherries. Oak certainly helps, providing smoky vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast richness, but the stemmy flavors don't go away.",Peters Vineyard,86,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Amphora
US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",Heintz Vineyard,96,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",Allen Vineyard,95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Nice and direct in ripe fruit and oak flavors, this is textbook proper Chardonnay. The flavors are of tropical fruits and spice, the texture is creamy, the finish is long and spicy.",,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"Quite a bit sweeter on the palate than J's Pinot Gris in the past, with a sugary edge to the otherwise pretty pineapple, vanilla and wildflower flavors. Acidity helps to balance, but this is not, strictly speaking, dry.",,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"The vineyard is virtually in Dry Creek Valley, so it's not surprising to find the briary, brambly intensity of that warm Sonoma appellation. It's a good, lush, likeable Zin, brimming with wild berry, leather, tobacco and pepper spice flavors swimming in firm, dry tannins.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,89,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,John Tyler
US,"Almost nobody in California makes a Columbard, especially in a high-rent district like Russian River, but this white wine deserves your attention. It's dry and very crisp in acidity, with flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, pears, honeysuckle flowers and spices. Great as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio.",Old Vines,89,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Colombard,Y Rousseau
US,"Sometimes Pinot Blanc resembles Chardonnay, but this crisp, minerally, citrusy wine strikes a different pose. It does have a rich, creamy mouthfeel, which gives it a full-bodied mouthfeel, but it has a dry, steely character that makes it far friendlier with food than a fat, buttery Chard.",,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Trinitas
US,"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences.",Unoaked,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Oaky, tannic and somewhat twiggy and minty to start, this Pinot has modest cherry and cola flavors. It's not showing particularly well, with some tightness, but gets fruitier and more charming as it breathes.",Lindley's Knoll,85,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards. It's almost what the French call demi-sec, with sugared lemon mousse and raspberry-vanilla cream flavors.",Vintage Brut,84,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Testarossa held back the release date for a while, but this is still a pretty tannic wine. Feels heavy and furry, although the complex black cherry, plum and bacon flavors break through to impress. A bit awkward tasted in the Spring of 2009, but could evolve after mid-2010.",Fritschen Vineyard,88,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,88,70,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Very vibrant in acidity and bright green fruit character, suggesting limes, lychee and lemongrass. A drop of Viognier and a tiny percent of oak add softening, enriching notes. Very fine and dry. Good with ceviche, grilled veggies on bruschetta topped with melted goat cheese.",Block Collection River Ranches,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
US,"Here's a gusty, bold Zin whose powerhouse flavors call for equally strong fare, such as braised short ribs and barbecue. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with explosive flavors of blackberries, plums, anise, balsamic-splashed sautéed mushrooms, espresso, tabasco and pepper. Finishes a bit Porty in raisins. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This beautiful Pinot Noir drinks well now because it's so fruity, delicately structured and crisp. Shows oak-inspired and refined raspberry, cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors that finish in a rich swirl of exotic spices. Has the inherent balance to develop through at least 2014.",The Whitewing Amber Ridge,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
US,"Very fine and complex. This deeply flavored Pinot Noir is powerful, but it's also elegantly silky, which is the magic combination. Shows perfectly ripe cherry and raspberry fruit, with gorgeous overtones of oak and spices. Beautiful now, and will age well through 2014 or so.",Nugent Vineyard,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir. Plays in the major leagues, with its refined texture and complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice and sandalwood, with a long, spicy finish. The most notable feature is the structure. Feels so lush and fine, so delectable, so dramatic. This is one of the best Pinots available for drinking now.",,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
US,"Merlot is tricky under the best circumstances, and this one is adequate, at best. Dry and fairly tannic, it shows modest, somewhat overripe blackberry flavors.",Estate,83,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Foppiano
US,"Shows a distinctly rustic note in the jagged tannins, green acids and somewhat thin blackberry fruit that's stretched with dill and mint. Sweet oak helps to fatten it up.",Estate,83,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Foppiano
US,"With apricot, pineapple, rice wine vinegar and white sugar flavors, this wine tastes like a sweet-and-sour sauce in a Chinese restaurant. The acidity is emphasized on the prickly finish.",Angeline,83,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Martin Ray
US,"Rough and common, this Cab tastes frankly sweet, like cherry and pomegranate jelly. It's also harsh, salty and acidic on the finish.",,81,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hook & Ladder
US,"There's not much, if any, oak on this Chardonnay, leaving the fresh, clean fruit flavors to star. Shows a rich array of pineapples, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots and peaches, with spicy, vanilla overtones. Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rued
US,"A little reedy, with unripe mint flavors and some sharpness. Redeems itself on the midpalate with a hit of cherries and cola, then reprises the sharpness on the finish. Ready now.",,85,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"Raw and hot, with a burnt cherry pie taste and a dry, tannic finish.",Estate,82,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Foppiano
US,"Dry and richly oaked, with ripe flavors, this is a big Chardonnay. It shows massive flavors of pineapple custard, pear jam, butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. A bit direct, but a crowd pleaser.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"A good everyday Zinfandel whose full-bodied, spicy fruitiness will satisfy with barbecue. It's a rugged, somewhat rustic wine with briary flavors of wild blackberries, leather, cola and pepper. Drink now.",Conte Vineyard,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
US,"Here's a big, gutsy Syrah that's ripe in blackberries, but also a little ungainly. There are some raisiny flavors as well as minty ones, giving it the taste of a Chinese sweet and sour cherry sauce.",Christensen Family Vineyard,85,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Volume is what this Zin is all about. The vineyard is in the warmest part of the valley, and the grapes sure did get ripe. They flood the mouth with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice and red plums, with a peppery, briary quality and a finish so softly sweet, it's almost chocolaty. Just yummy.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"A beautiful wine, just what Pinot Gris should be. Drily crisp, with a mouth-cleansing raciness, it offers complex flavors of citrus fruits, flowers and minerals, wrapped into a creamy texture.",Windsor Oaks Vineyard,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Terremoto Cellars
US,"Ripely fruity and soft, showing upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, tobacco, cola, mocha and pepper. Tastes a little sweet in charred wood extract.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"This has picked up softness and a honeyed mouthfeel, as the chemistry of aging on the lees does its magic. The wine has a plush, creamy feeling, with the silky smoothness of a great sparkling wine. Flavorwise, it's all pears, limes, dough and cinnamon spice. Delicious now, and should hold and improve over the next eight years.",Late Disgorged Brut,93,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Great Chardonnay, exotically rich and complex. With the crisp, zesty acidity of Russian River in a cool vintage, the wine is impressively balanced despite its powerhouse flavors. Pineapples, mangoes, papayas, new oak, minerals and Asian spices mingle together, leading to a long finish.",Ritchie Vineyard,93,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"From the coolest part of Green Valley, this wonderfully rich Chardonnay has a steely crispness that hits the palate like a laser. The pineapple, apple, kiwi and lime flavors, enhanced with smoky oak, are complex and satisfying. This is a high-class wine that deserves to be served with gourmet fare.",Dutton Palms Vineyard,94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"The aromatics on this wine are so inviting. This is a huge Pinot, young, dry and sappy at this time, with grape, cola, rhubarb, black cherry and rosehip tea flavors, set off by crisp acids and silky tannins. Despite the size, it maintains a complex elegance. It's very good now, but will benefit from a few years in the bottle.",Klopp Ranch,93,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dobles lías, “double lees,” tells you this is a leesy wine, and that slight sour-creamy flavor dominates. This is a wine you love or don't. I find it refreshingly dry and complex, not a fruit bomb, but a dry, elegant Chard, in which new French oak adds enriching notes.",Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"One hundred percent new French oak is the dominant theme here. It floods the mouth with the flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. The oak influence is strong, but the underlying wine has some equally strong pineapple, mango and apple fruit. It's made in a rich California style you either love or hate.",,91,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Parallel
US,"This is a complicated young Pinot; and while the parts are all pretty and polished, they haven't knitted together. Voluptuous flavors of cherries, cola, spices and cedar are wrapped into silky tannins, and the acidity is fine and brisk, but as good as the wine is, it seems unfinished, like the score to a symphony that has yet to be played. Give this until mid-2008, and it should be terrific for the next four years.",Nicole's Vineyard,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Very gentle and fruity and so easy to drink. Flatters with waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, milk chocolate and anise, yet balanced with fine tannins and a dry, crisp finish. Drink now.",,87,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hook & Ladder
US,"A fine evocation of a Russian River Pinot from a good vintage. It's dry and silky and crisp, with rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, cedar, cinnamon and pepper. Delicious. Drink now.",,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"You have to wonder if the winemaker, who sold to Allied-Domecq in 2004, decided to make his Pinots fruitier to appeal to changing consumers tastes. Maybe it was the very hot vintage. In any case, this is more in keeping with California's superripe Pinots than Farrell's formerly tight, acidic ones, with excellent results. It's deliciously drinkable, although perhaps not so ageable.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyard,92,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Impressive for the enormous depth and range of the fruit, which is a blast of pineapple custard, kiwi, Key lime pie, and the ripest, sweetest white peach, all of it coated in fine, toasty oak. This is a big Chardonnay that calls for rich fare, like lobster.",Indindoli Vineyard Reserve,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Waugh Cellars
US,"The winery's Saralee's bottling has been variable over the years. The '06 is tasty and eminently drinkable if you want a nice, dry, crisp Pinot. It's pale in color, silky in the mouth, and direct in cherry, cola, spice and oaky flavors. Drink now.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",Director's Cut,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Dry and distinctly wild in brambly, briary berry fruit and spice. At first this Zin feels rustic, with a sandpapery grip and fresh, juicy acids. But the brilliant structure of acidity, bracing tannins and caressing mouthfeel reveal how delicate this really is. This is great Zinfandel.",Lone Redwood Ranch,94,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"At more than four years of age, this Pinot still tastes fresh and lively. It has a juicy acidity that frames classic Russian River Pinot flavors of cherries, cola and rhubarb, and is dry and silky. There's still an edge of dusty tannins. Try this well-crafted wine with lamb or rib roast.",,91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belvedere
US,"Unbalanced, with a hot, Porty mouthfeel and medicinal, sweet-and-sour cherry flavors.",Dolinsek Ranch Reserve,82,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mara
US,"You don't want to drink this wine now. It's way too tannic, which also accentuates the acidity. It all makes for a tough palate experience, despite rich raspberry, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. So stash this vastly interesting Pinot Noir in your cellar for 3–5 years. But if you can't, decant. Even overnight.",Westside Road Neighbors,91,67,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.",Dutton Ranch Dutton Palms Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"Nearly five years after it was made, this Syrah remains dark and tannic, but the fruit is starting to make the magical transition from primary to secondary. It's picking up dried blackberry, dessicated blueberry and beef jerky flavors that finish long and spicy. Yet it still has youthful acidity and freshness. This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is a new wine from Longboard. The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the Middle Reach area that is prime Pinot country. But somehow, Merlot loves it. Softly lush and complex, with blackberry, blueberry, cherry, cola and spiced coffee flavors, finishing with new oaky vanillins. Really notable for its balance and harmony.",DaKine Vineyard,92,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard
US,"Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy. Acidity is high, and gives a tangy minerality that adds complexity.",Dutton Ranch Kyndall's Reserve,92,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
US,"Only a fine, cool-climate vineyard could have grown this Pinot. It combines ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors with crispness and a delicate, silky mouthfeel. The end result is a dry, complex wine of considerable charm and a drink-me-again deliciousness.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kindred
US,"Could be a bit firmer and more structured in acidity. Shows a soft, easy, silky texture, with forward flavors of melted blackberry jam, sour red cherry, cola, and cinnamon spice, with some bitterness in the finish. Drink now.",The Whitewing Amber Ridge Vineyard,87,49,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
US,"Very fruity, in fact superfruity, this wine attacks with ripe pie-filling raspberries, red cherries, pomegranates, cola and vanilla-cocoa flavors that flood the mouth, lasting through a long, spicy finish. All that fruit is balanced with crisp acids, while a touch of dusty tannins adds to the fullness. Drink now.",Reserve,89,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
US,"Easily the best Hanna Pinot Noir in memory, this pretty wine is light and crisp and delicious, with cherry, cola, cocoa, anise and spice flavors. Nice now with lamb chops, roast salmon.",,87,31,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanna
US,"An elegant, nicely varietal Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's dry and silky, with crisp acidity framing charming flavors of cherries, rhubarb pie, cola and pepper spice.",Reserve,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Very rich and opulent, if a little soft. Offers an explosion of ripe black cherries, raspberries, licorice, mocha, black pepper and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on.",Carlisle Vineyard,87,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy
US,"Light-bodied, soft and pastry-rich, with easy flavors of cherry, raspberry and vanilla granola. Nice now, with its silky texture and instant appeal.",Chenoweth Ranch,87,55,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"A bit heavy on the oak, with vanilla, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. But the pineapple and apple fruit is nice and ripe, and the finish is rich in spicy honey.",,87,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,In Re
US,"Enormously ripe berries characterize this wine; it explodes with wild raspberries, cherries, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a peppery, minty finish. But it's young and vigorous in rich, dense tannins, suggesting ageability. Best now, with decanting, and for several years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"For the price, this dessert wine is quite a good buy in an upscale sweetie. It shows honeyed flavors of apricots, pineapples, oranges, vanilla fudge and cinnamon spice.",Oley Sweet,87,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
US,"Few wineries in California any longer produce this Chardonnay-like French variety, but Dutton-Goldfield continues to do a good job. It has a creamy texture, with flavors of peaches, green apples, pears, vanilla and cinnamon spice. With no oak, it's a clean, crisply acidic wine.",Dutton Ranch Shop Block,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Sebastiani reaches to the Russian River Valley Duttons for this rich, crisp and complex Chardonnay. It displays classic cool-climate acidity that makes the tropical fruit flavors sing, while oak adds intriguing smoke, vanilla and woodspice notes.",Dutton Ranch,89,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
US,"Not quite as rich or complex as the Reserve, but close on its heels, with well-ripened tropical fruit flavors accented by spicy, toasty oak. This is a classic California cool-climate Chard, with bright, zesty acidity.",Indindoli Vineyard,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Waugh Cellars
US,"This is the driest, most austere of Arista's current Pinots. It's not a hedonistic wine. It offers a mouthful of acidity and earthy, truffly tastes, with a hint of cherries and cranberries. It doesn't slap you with fruit, but it's a wine you'll return to for a third glass when the fruit bombs have palled. Best now, but will hold for five years.",Longbow,93,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance.",Keefer Ranch,85,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Novy
US,"Super-ripe and dry, with raisin and Port flavors wrapped into 16.5% alcohol. It's a good example of what it is, but certainly exceeds balance.",,82,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
US,"Young and forward, here's a seductive wine that's instantly attractive for its lush flavors and silky mouthfeel. Cherry pie filling, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cocoa and coffee flavors mark this delicious Pinot, which finishes with crisp acids. It was made by Paul Hobbs.",,92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stewart
US,"A distinctive Chardonnay made in the Farrell style, which leans toward acidic and elegant. But this is not an austere wine, far from it. It has a rich minerality and flavors of lime and pineapple custard, and then an even richer crème brûlée finish. Delicious and complex.",Cresta Ridge Vineyard,92,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Big, raw and frankly not really showing its best now, this young Zin needs time in the bottle. It has everything that it takes for two or three years aging, at least. Aromas and flavors of crushed pepper, fennel seed and cardamom spice up the blackberry, roasted coffee and bitter chocolate flavors, while the tannins are hefty, but negotiable.",Feeney Vineyard,91,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"Sonoma Valley Cabernet specialist Cohn reaches to the Russian River to expand his portfolio with this Pinot Noir. It's not a stretch to call it Bordeaux-style. Although it has the variety's telltale silkiness and medium body, the blackberry, cola, coffee, leather and oak flavors, not to mention the tannins, possess density and gravity, which may make this wine ageable. Best now through 2011.",,88,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
US,"A brisk, clean Chardonnay with a firm footing of minerals undergirding polished pineapple, pear and cedar flavors. Offers lots of sophisticated pleasure at a good price.",Barrel Reserve,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Toasted Head
US,"A bit overripe in raisins, with a chocolate-currant core enriched with smoky new oak. But the texture is silky and fine, and the finish is dry and spicy. Drink now.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longboard
US,"Shows good character in the dryness, crispness, smooth tannins and silky texture that frame ripe cherry pulp, cola, vanilla and pepper flavors. On the minus side is a sharply acidic finish. Drink soon.",Heintz Ranch,87,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutch Bill Creek
US,"White Oak has done a good job with Chard over the years, and this fruit-forward bottling offers lots of pleasure. Apples, peaches, kiwis and limes star in this crisply tart, dry wine, which is only lightly oaked.",,88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,White Oak
US,"From a cool part of the appellation comes this dry, potent wine, rich in gooseberry, pink grapefruit, fig and lemongrass aromas. Zesty, citrusy acidity makes this fruit-forward wine perfect with a salad of mixed bitter greens, chevre, toasted walnuts and a creamy raspberry vinaigrette.",Slusser Road Vineyard,88,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"This is from the cooler, southern portion of the valley, and the climate shows in the notable tannins and acids that put the wine in lockdown. Yet it's a very fine Syrah, rich and classy in meaty blackberry and coffee flavors and a luscious finish of blueberry tart. You could enjoy this single-vineyard wine now, but it should soften and develop additional bottle complexities from 2007 through 2010.",Trenton Station Vineyard,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"Chards are tight, acidic and minerally in youth, showing a lees-infused structure but offering waves of complexity. With toasty oak, the base flavors are of nectarines, mangoes, peaches, zesty green apples and dustings of Asian spice.",Don Miguel Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Right now this single-vineyard Pinot is a little gawky. It may be too young, and it's hard to tell where it's going. The individual parts are good but they haven't come together. There's a lot of primary cherry and cola fruit, adequate acidity, dusty tannins and rich oak. Try stashing it in a cool cellar for three or four years.",Wren Hop Vineyard,88,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Holdredge
US,"Pours lightish in ruby color, smells rich and detailed in Pinot aromas, and drinks dry and elegant, with ripe Pinot fruit. What's not to like? Cherries, cola, rosehip tea and cinnamon spice flavors mingle into a wonderfully long finish, in a texture marked by silk and satin. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A terrific Zinfandel, with a polished, pretty structure and ripe, vibrantly classic Zinny flavors. Floods the mouth with berries, cola, licorice, mocha and dusty spices, wrapped into beautifully fine, ripe tannins. Impossible to resist sip after sip. Defines Russian River Zinfandel at its best.",Belloni Single Vineyard,94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"The vintage was very kind to Chardonnay, and the balance shows in the fantastically ripe, exotic pineapple tart, lemondrop candy, buttered toast, sandalwood and sweet, dusty spice flavors of this immaculately dry, crisp wine. It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,94,41,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Here's a very dry, stylish Pinot, and while it has plenty of fruit, it has mushroom, balsamic and soy flavors that deepen and ground the cherries and cola. The overall impression is of a young, complex, fleshy Pinot that should hold and develop for five years.",Don Miguel Vineyard,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"A nice bubbly that's mainly Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It shows Champagne flavors suggesting citrus fruits, pears, strawberries and bread, with crisp acidity making the finish clean. The mouthfeel is a little rough and scoury.",Vintage Brut,87,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"With an acidity that titillates the tastebuds and pure flavors of red cherries, cola, mocha and woodspice, this dry Pinot is very food friendly. It's not particularly oaky, nor is it complex, but offers plenty of satisfaction. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"A nice Syrah that appeals for its lush flavors. It's too soft, with a melted quality, but the blackberry, chocolate, leather, anise and pepper flavors are so tasty, you hardly notice.",,86,12,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Duende
US,"A nice, easy drinking Sauvignon Blanc that shows the citrusy acids that make this variety so popular. Shows pineapple, honeysuckle, orange blossom, lemon zest and vanilla spice flavors that finish a little sweet, but clean and zesty.",,86,19,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"This wine is very similar to Arista's regular Pinot, but considerably more concentrated. It's bone dry, silky in texture, fairly alcoholic, full-bodied and complex in cherry, cola, rhubarb and peppery spice flavors, with a tannin-acid backbone that suggests aging through 2011.",Harper's Rest,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"A big, young Pinot Noir that shows brilliant stuffing and complexity, but it's rather heavy and tannic now, and not a wine to open before, say, 2011 at the very least. In its youth it displays rich, jammy flavors of red cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood, and is very dry. Should evolve slowly through 2015 or beyond.",Starr Ridge Vineyard - Dijon Clones,92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Rich and forward in spicy fruit, with a sweet rhubarb edge veering into cola and cocoa. Finishes with an elegant flourish of oak-infused fruit. A complex, multi-layered wine that will handle some years of bottle age.",,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Lovely and complicated; a Pinot Noir for Cabernet lovers. It has Pinot's silky texture and soft tannins, but also a full-bodied, oak-infused weight that carries wonderfully ripe cherry pie, anise, cola and raspberry flavors that change from sip to sip.",,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belvedere
US,"An interesting wine that makes you think. Straddles the border between minty wintergreen unripeness and cherry-cola ripeness, coming down in favor of the latter. Streamlined and elegant, it's good now for the dry crispness, but not an ager. Drink soon.",Dutton Thomas Road Vineyard,89,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"A touch of barnyard funk gives this Pinot an old-fashioned Burgundian touch. But the fruit is all California, suggesting ripe cherries and raspberries, coated with plenty of sweet, smoky oak. A very nice, high-class Pinot Noir for drinking now and through 2013.",,89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"This is a good, everyday Merlot with some additional qualities of elegance. It's soft and mellow, with nice flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, chocolate and licorice.",,86,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Angeline
US,"Easily the best MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir ever. Shows impressive depth and complexity, with rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, pomegranates, persimmons and smoky sandalwood, finished with tangy Asian spices. Tastes a bit jammy, suggesting a few years in the bottle.",Winemaker's Block Selection,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"We're almost into Port here, not only in the alcohol level, but the flavors. The blackberries, strawberries, raspberries and cherries are almost raisiny, with that taste of plumped dried fruit, leading to a finish of raspberry liqueur. Yet the wine is dry, as well as tannic. There are certainly few Zinfandels like this anywhere, and you'll either like it or you won't.",Mancini Ranch,89,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This is quite a sophisticated Chard, showing the quality of wines that cost far more. It's rich, with toasty oak that frames flavors of pineapples, buttered toast, spicy mango and ripe white peach. Feels creamy through a long, spicy finish.",Reserve Selection,87,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hayman & Hill
US,"Although it's a bit one-dimensional, this is textbook Pinot Noir. It's lightly silky and delicate in the mouth, and dry, with crisp acids carrying flavors of cherries, cola and spice.",Russian River Selection,85,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"It's easy drinking with this silky, delicate Pinot, with its flavors of rhubarb, beet, cola and cherry, and cinnamon-spice finish. This dry wine is probably at its best now.",,85,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hawley
US,"Martin Ray's second label is proving to be a good value. This Zin is exuberantly ripe in black cherry fruit, with a rich earthiness. It's a bit sharp, but that will actually help to stand up to olive oil, cheese, butter and meats.",,85,10,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Angeline
US,"In making a lateral move to Pinot Noir, Mitch Cosentino brings a Napa Cabernet sensibility to this variety. This is a big, dark, extracted Pinot, an attractive wine with its chocolate and blueberry flavors, but rather heavy-handed for a wine that should be elegant and crisp.",,85,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,M. Cosentino
US,"Call it Chablis-like. This Chard is bone dry, crisp in citrusy acidity, and features stony, minerally flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. Try as a richer alternative to Pinot Grigio.",Lot 115,86,13,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
US,"Tastes like there's lots of toasty, charry, smoky oak on this big, ripe wine, but the papaya, nectarine and hazelnut croissant flavors are sizeable and can shoulder the wood. The finish is long, spicy and impressively rich.",Ulises Valdez Vineyard,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mi Sueño
US,"A beautiful wine, dry, complex and crisp, and easily one of the best white Rhône-style bottlings of the vintage. It shows brilliantly clean acidity that provides a brisk mouthfeel to the apricot, pineapple and pear flavors that rest on a firm ground of minerals. Great as a richer, more exotic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.",Saralee's Vineyard,92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Eric Ross
US,"A very pale wine, barely more than a rosé in hue, but very flavorful. Enraptures the palate with vanilla-scented raspberry Newton, orange biscotti, cola, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that swirl into a long, spicy finish. Not an ager, but perfect now with grilled salmon or a fine ham.",Saralee's Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Eric Ross
US,"If you like a purely California approach to Zin, you'll exult in this one. High in alcohol, almost Porty, but totally dry, with stewed raspberry, cherry, cola, mocha and spice flavors, it's tough in tannins, and acidic for so ripe a wine. Will do all kinds of interesting things over the next 10 years, without fundamentally changing.",Zeigler Vineyard,89,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Too acidic and sweet for my tastes, with well-ripened cherry and mocha flavors that are certainly flattering. The sweetness seems to get stronger as the wine warms up, making it an awkward sip.",Winemaker's Block Selection,83,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"The Dutton-Goldfield style is to emphasize acidity and minerality, then to lavish winemaker interventions in the form of oak and lees. This is a Chablisian wine, if you will, dry and crisp, with complex flavors ranging from lemons and cinnamon to gun metal and pineapples. It's very elegant and food-friendly.",Rued Vineyard Dutton Ranch,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is an intricate, detailed Pet that's not as heavy or tannic, and considerably more complex, than most. It has the weight of a fine Zin, with rich flavors of spiced plums, blackberries, espresso, clove and anise, and a brambly finish of fresh, wild berries and pepper.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Foppiano
US,"What Dutton Ranch Chards share is a crisp, appley crunchiness, edging into the tropics in a good vintage. In this case, it adds rich new oak and a creamy, leesy mouthfeel, and the flavors approach decadent guava and nectarine.",Dutton Ranch,91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Davis Family
US,"Dry, soft and earthy, this Pinot Noir shows flavors of cherries, cola, tobacco, black pepper and herbs, wrapped into a silky texture. It could develop additional bottle complexities over the next few years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,86,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,John Tyler
US,"Made in a ripe style, this Cab bursts with jammy black currant, plum and coffee flavors that finish rich and sweet. But it's also got a firm texture, with fine-grained tannins and a keen edge of acidity. The result is a balanced and stylish Cab that should hold for at least seven years.",OFS,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Loach
US,"This delicious Pinot shows Russian River at its best. The wine is fully dry and balanced, with a rich, full-bodied mouthfeel that remains silky and smooth. The flavors are wonderful, all cherry marmalade, dusty cocoa, espresso and sweet oak.",,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A dry, medium-bodied Pinot that shows very ripe fruit, easy tannins and a crisp bite of acidity. The flavors are delicious, all black cherries, sweet rhubarb tea, cola, vanilla and cinnamon. It's a wine you'll find yourself reaching for a second and a third time.",,90,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Foppiano
US,"Starts with rubbery, tar aromas, but they fade with time. But along the way there's a funky, sort of smoked ham note. Flavors of ginger and citrus are full and round, and they carry a honeyed accent. With that said, one reviewer was not a fan and found the wine far outside the parameters of “varietal correctness.”",,87,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"In every vintage you can predict one thing about this wine: that it will be extremely oaky. Here the aromas are so toasted they almost cover the peach and melon lurking below. The palate offers lots of spice and white pepper along with peach, apple and herbs. The intensity of the fruit and the natural acidity save it from falling into the category of “severely overoaked.”",La Petite Etoile Vineyard,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean
US,"This is the best Jewel Block bottling ever from Dutton. The vineyard is in the heart of Green Valley, one of the coolest parts of Russian River, and the magnificent vintage has yielded a fantastically ripe wine, balanced with rich, crisp acidity. The flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, tangerine zest and dusty Asian spices are rich and deep, but the wine is very young. Give it until mid-2008, and it will drink well through 2013, at least.",Jewel Block Vineyard,94,47,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"This is one of the palest Pinots of the vintage, so translucent, you can hardly believe its power. A blend of various Dutton Ranch vineyards the result is serious and fabulous, a complex wine with cherry, cola and spice flavors and a luxuriously silky texture. This is textbook, world class RRV Pinot from a very great vintage.",Karmen Isabella,94,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Beautiful, irresistable Syrah, lush and sweet in fruit and oak. Soft and velvety, it offers layers of puréed raspberries, cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a rich edge of toasted marshmallow, gingerbread and butterscotch. Yet it's dry, with modest alcohol.",,94,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Merry Edwards nailed this one. Lush and smooth as velvet, it shows enormously deep, ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, leather, cola, soy-splashed Portobello, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. But it's also a very young wine, to judge from the freshness of acids and tannins. Drink now, with decanting, and should age well for up to a decade.",Olivet Lane Méthode a l'Ancienne,94,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Superripe and super-oaked, with syrupy fruit flavors, this is somebody's idea of the popular style, but it's really an exaggerrated one. Where's the balance?",,83,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"This very rich, ripe and forward Pinot Noir can be opened now for its vast array of raspberries, cherries, cola, red licorice and smoky sandalwood. It grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, showing facets of pomegranates and violets. Will provide good drinking through 2014.",Karmen Isabella,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"This is just too young to drink now. The interplay of the acids and tannins locks down the flavors and make a sting on the palate. But there is the terrific core of flavor, of ripe blackberries and cherries, of red and black currants, of cola and root beer and licorice, that will emerge in time, making for delicious drinking. Best 2009–2013, possibly longer.",Quail Hill Vineyard,93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"This wine has too much alcohol, namely 15.8%, and finishes hot and raisiny. Awkward exaggerations of what Zin should be.",Feeney Vineyard,83,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"There's plenty of ripe fruit here, but the wine has too much oak, and has a weird salty flavor. The varietal identity is proper.",,83,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Alderbrook
US,"A sort of Super-Tuscan, although a rustic one, dry and acidic, with flavors of fresh berries. Cab Sauv, Cab Franc and Sangiovese.",The Tillerman,83,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Hook & Ladder
US,"Lots to admire about this polished Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky in the mouth, with voluptuous flavors of raspberries, cherries, currants, licorice and cola. You'll also find plenty of zesty acidity. Needs some time to knit together and mellow. Better by late 2010 or 2011.",,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stewart
US,"De Loach's 30th Anniversary Pinot, from the same vintage, was a stupendous wine, and while this isn't as rich, it's in the same vein. It's very ripe in cherry pie, cocoa puff, cola and oak flavors, with a honeyed finish. Yet it's dry, and maintains balance and harmony throughout. If you like lots of fruit in your Pinot, this is a good pick.",,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"The home vineyard is in a cool, southeastern part of the valley, and you can smell the minerality in this crisp, young wine, grown in the fog. It's exceptionally bright in steely tangerine, kiwi and pineapple flavors whose smoky oak veneer is in perfect balance.",Proprietor Grown,92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanna
US,"Kind of earthy and mute, and also soft, with the flavor of canned fruit syrup, although it's fairly dry.",Dylan,82,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Oriel
US,"I like the dryness and crispness of this food-friendly wine, but it's not the fruitiest Chard to come down the pike. It's an earthy wine, with herb flavors veering into peaches, and enough oaky-leesy creaminess to add interest.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Offers lots to like in a dry, intensely fruity Zin, whose blackberry, cherry, cocoa and tart cranberry flavors explode on the palate. Such a wine could be ordinary, but the balance is impeccable.",,88,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Acorn has produced one of their best bottlings ever. The wine is drily crisp and tannic, but rich and supple, with cassis, cherry and carob flavors that have an earthy, mushroom and tobacco grounding. The wine contains smaller amounts of at least 10 other varieties, in the manner of an old field blend.",Alegria Vineyards Heritage Vines,91,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Acorn
US,"Lots of ripe tropical fruit in this wine, with pastry-filling pineapple, peach, butterscotch and vanilla spice flavors. Although technically dry, it has a richly honeyed finish.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"An odd wine that started with stubborn sulfur that was slow to blow off, then turns too sweet and still seems to be fizzy with fermentation. Impossible to recommend.",,81,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
US,"I criticized Williams Selyem's Feeney Vineyard Zin for overly high alcohol, at 15.8 percent. This one is an inexcusable 16.3 percent. I wish someone would explain to me why it's necessary to harvest at these levels, unless you're making Port.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,80,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
US,"A bit harsh and green in tannins, with menthol-infused blackberry and cherry flavors that finish in a scour of pepper. Drink now.",Reserve Richard McDowell Vineyard,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Toad Hollow
US,"A solid effort. Dry, delicately silky and elegant, this polished wine shows flavors of red cherries, raspberries, cola and rosehip tea, with an Asian spice finish. Pair with steak.",Reserve,87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Pretty good Sauv Blanc, a little one-dimensional, but satisfies for its flowery, citrus blossom and passionfruit flavors that finish in a swirl of palate-stimulating spices.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"A little thin for my tastes, still there's some decent citrus and spearmint fruit, and the wine is dry, tart and clean on the finish.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"There's a lot going on in this dry, tart wine, with its vivid flavors of gooseberry, lime, grapefruit and passion fruit. From a single vineyard, it possesses an intensity and focus that make it particularly enjoyable.",Poplar Vineyard,88,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Taft Street
US,"Tasted beside Stemmler's estate Pinot, this one's richer and more concentrated, but very similar, even though it's from a different appellation, suggesting a consistent winemaker approach. It's medium-bodied and silky, with ripe rhubarb, cola and cherry-pie flavors finished with oak and vanilla. Drink this elegant and complex wine now.",Nugent Vineyard,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"There's a lot of well-toasted oak on this wine, but it's easily able to handle it. In fact, the wood meshes seamlessly with the bright, intense cherry, pomegranate and spice flavors to produce extreme complexity. Still young and vibrant. Best in a year or so.",Fritschen Vineyard,93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"I like this wine because it's different. You'll find green apple and pineapple flavors, and various toasted notes of wood, coconut and hazelnut, not to mention lees and Oriental spice. Those crisp Green Valley acids undergird the richness. Finishes complex and with great finesse.",Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"Shows great class and finesse with its well-ripened fruit that's controlled with a clean minerality and high acidity. Oak and lees are both there, in supporting roles. The finish is ultraclean and citrusy, in this complex, dry white wine.",Dutton Ranch,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Arista's basic Pinot, which contains some Anderson Valley fruit, is textbook cool-climate Pinot, very dry and quite acidic. It's a little diluted, but enjoyable for its cherry, cola and toast flavors that finish in a great burst of peppery spice.",,87,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Off a bit from the '05, but still a good wine, this Sauvignon Blanc shows fresh minty lemongrass, melon, green grass and fennel flavors, backed up with firm acids and, as always, very dry.",,86,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"Herbal and bulky, with sweet apple, pear and pineapple flavors. Quite heavy on the tongue, with soft acids. Seems a bit gummy and candied, and just not that precise, despite delivering some rich flavors.",check price,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Armida
US,"The alcohol is nearly 16%. Yikes! And it shows, with a hot mouthfeel and a glyceriney sweetness. Too bad, because the underlying wine, with cherry, cola, cedar and spice flavors, seems fine.",,84,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle

US,"The 2005 vintage was a good one for the vineyard, cool and steady, yielding dry, balanced wines, including this low-production Syrah. The tannins are of the furry-fuzzy kind, framing blackberry, cola, tobacco, vanilla and sage flavors.",Alegria Vineyards Axiom,90,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
US,"Try this as a refreshing alternative to Chardonnay. It's drier and more tart than most RRV Chards, but otherwise is similar in the oak-infused pineapple, peach, pear, orange and spice flavors and rich, creamy texture.",Dutton Ranch Shop Blanc,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",Olivet Lane Estate Reserve,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellegrini
US,"There's a smoky aroma that's almost cigarette ashy, and a distractingly sweet sugary finish to the cherry and cola flavors of this Pinot Noir. Could be going through a dumb phase. Try after 2009.",Graham Family Vineyard,84,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,August West
US,"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished Sauvignon benefits from very high acidity that makes those tastebuds whistle. It shows fig, Tequila, grapefruit and nectarine flavors and a finish of white pepper. Notable for its dry, keen freshness.",,86,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
US,"With a tomato-skin bitterness that considerable oak treatment can't quite diminish, this Pinot is saved by a finish of sweet, ripe cherries. Still, it's a study in contrasts. It shows elegance and harmony one minute, then that rustic note emerges.",Dutton Ranch,86,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"There's lots of ripe berry flavor in this Pinot, whose mouthfeel has a certain rustic character. It's a heavy wine, dark, thick and jammy, with a chocolaty feel to the cherries and rhubarb pie flavors, although it's completely dry.",Burnside Vineyard Reserve,86,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rutz
US,"My favorite of N&N;'s three new single-vineyard Chards. Shows broad appeal with its array of peach, apple and tropical fruit flavors, heightened with touches of oak and lees. Young and crisp in acids, it's full-bodied enough to accompany roast duck.",Searby Vineyard,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nickel & Nickel
US,"Quite an interesting wine, chewy and dense in apple, melon and peach fruits and oak, with a chalky, minerally taste that adds texture. Turns tart with acids on the finish.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bannister
US,"Lots of perky acidity here, to offset and balance the superripe black currant and cocoa flavors. There's a spicy note of licorice or anise that adds to the profile. Fancy stuff. Search out the perfect recipe for this one.",Century Vine,90,46,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ledson
US,"Too sweet by a mile, this Pinot, made from a variety of Dijon clones and older selections, tastes like it has residual sugar. The alcohol, which at 13.9% is relatively low for California, may explain that.",,82,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Holdredge
US,"There's a rusticity here that's partly a function of Zin's wild, brambly nature, and partly due to a raisiny sweet finish. On the plus side is a rich, round mouthfeel and delicious cherry, cranberry and mocha fruit and spice. The September harvest heat wave must have been a huge challenge, even for talented grapegrowers such as the Duttons.",,85,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Pinotphiles will appreciate that this was 100% destemmed for fermentation. The fruit is the star, suggesting freshly crushed blackberries, cherries, black raspberries and cola, spiced up with cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. An elegant sipper that gets better as it warms. Try decanting for a couple hours before serving.",,89,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Verve
US,"Alderbrook's Pinots are usually clean, well made and typically varietal, with crisp acids and ripe, pleasant flavors of cola, cherries, rhubarb pie, vanilla and spice. Drink this light, easy wine now and over the next year.",,86,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alderbrook
US,"Earthy, with cherry pie filling, cola, rhubarb, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. This dry wine is a little soft and one-dimensional, but has a silky mouthfeel.",Ulises Valdez Vineyard,85,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mi Sueño
US,"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished SB benefits from crisp acidity provoked by its cool growing region. The flavors are of figs, citrus fruits and nectarines, but they could be a bit more focused.",,85,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
US,"Lots of toasty oak on this very dry wine, and a big burst of citrusy acids. In fact the fruit veers toward lemons, limes and grapefruits, just nudging into riper green apples and peaches.",Reserve Selection,85,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hayman & Hill
US,"Simple and clean, this Pinot has good qualities and offers pleasure without being complex. It's light-bodied, dry and silky, with cherry, cola and rhubarb pie flavors.",,85,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum

US,"The winery specializes in single-vineyard wines, and this is certainly a unique Chardonnay, but it's not an opulent one. On the contrary, it's flinty, acidic and raspingly dry, which makes one think it was picked early. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with its puckery lemon flavors.",Searby Vineyard,85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nickel & Nickel
US,"Smells herbal and minty, which is strange given the vintage's heat, and tastes earthy, too, with oregano and barely ripe cherry flavors. Turns dry and crisp on the finish. Consider this an elegant style.",Dutton Ranch,85,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"This is a clean, dry earthy, acidic wine, but it's a little thin in fruit, and lovers of Viognier's opulence will be disappointed, despite the elegance. The flavors veer toward lemon zest and minerals.",,84,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Arger-Martucci

US,"A very rich Syrah, packed with pepper, blackberries, currants, cherries, cola and licorice, and wrapped into the smoothest tannins you can imagine. Offers a lot of complexity and a beautiful, long finish.",Christensen Family Vineyard,88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"The '05 has produced a fresh, brisk young wine that's firm in immature acids and young, jammy cherry and black raspberry fruit. Its pedigree shows in the balance and the rich, ripe tannins that only a superior cool-climate vineyard can provide. But it's too young now, and hasn't proven itself capable of aging. Try after 2008.",Dutton Ranch Sanchietti Vineyard,88,58,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Tannic now, but with such a solid heart of fruit, it should blossom by the end of 2008 or early 2009. The color is translucent ruby, the texture wonderfully silky and light, except for those hard tannins. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, cranberries, cola and pomegranates are just waiting to emerge.",,88,36,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Rather heavy and thick for a Pinot, with cherry, coffee and cocoa flavors that finish dry. Fans of fuller-bodied Pinots will like this style, but it really could use more delicacy.",Windsor Gardens,85,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rutz
US,"Not particularly complex, but does a nice job with its cola, cherry, spice and vanilla flavors that drink soft and crisp. It's an easy Pinot that will be good with a wide range of food.",,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Murphy-Goode
US,"Soft and simple, this is almost a dessert wine—it's that sweet in raspberry-tart filling and cherry jam flavors. Has just enough acidity but the sugary finish is off-putting.",Nugent Vineyard,84,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"This is not the Calcaire that was so famous years ago. It feels stretched and pulled and thin, like a Chard one-third its price. Barrel fermentation and sur lies aging are all very nice, but the fruit just isn't there to justify this price.",Calcaire,84,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"Too much acidity in this dry, fruity Pinot. Pale in color, it shows silky tannins and nice cherry, cola and spicy oak flavors, but that minty sharpness is awkward.",Galante Vineyard,84,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Harrington
US,"This Chard, from two famous vineyards, is a little too tart now for enjoyment. It has a roughness that detracts from the underlying fruit, while the oak sticks out. My hunch is that three or four years will reward your patience.",Rochioli & Allen Vineyards,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bannister
US,"Turning leafy-foresty, very delicate. Subtle tea, clove, cinnamon, cherry, dusty, cedar, cocoa. Fresh. Lots of sweet fruit, cherries, balanced, silky, so supple and clean. Lots of rich dusty tannins. Bone dry. Complex, interesting. Now-2010.",Three Corner Vineyard Reserve,94,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Crisp in fresh acids, with a leesy flavor and texture. The fruit veers toward tart citrus fruits, candied apples, and metallic minerals. Finishes with a lime-skin bitterness.",Gail Ann's Vineyard,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Russian Hill
US,"Rather heavy in texture, with the weight of a Rhone wine, and thick, fruity flavors of plums, heirloom tomatoes, cola, espresso and oak. Very dry, with smooth tannins. This is a big Pinot, clean and complex, although not particularly delicate.",Estate,87,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Russian Hill
US,"The most important things about this wine are its upfront oak and full-bodied character. The former brings vanilla, toast and sweet oak shadings to the black cherry and cola fruit. It's soft in acids, which may explain a certain heaviness, but it sure is tasty.",,87,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Papapietro Perry
US,"Clean, dry and crisp in acidity, this wine has citrus and fig flavors, with an edge of tangy gooseberry. It's nice and elegant, but finishes a little thin.",Marino Vineyard,84,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Crinella

US,"A little on the thin side, this wine has modest green apple, pink grapefruit and vanilla char flavors. It's bone dry and crisp, with a fast finish.",Director's Cut,84,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Decent everyday Chard, but disappointingly thin, especially for a reserve. All the parts are here, from the creamy mouthfeel and oak to the pineapple and nectarine flavors, but it's like a photocopy of a photocopy.",Reserve,84,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"Sharp and dry, this Chianti-style wine has cherry, date, grilled mushroom, balsam and vanilla flavors. The nicest part is the silky texture, light and elegant, like a Pinot Noir. Needs rich meats, pasta or risotto to show its best.",Alegría Vineyards,88,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Acorn
US,"If you like your Chards citrusy, tart and on the mineral side, this is for you. Some will find it thin, others will call it elegant and food friendly. For me, at this price, it's a disappointment, although it's certainly oaky.",Gail Ann's Vineyard,84,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Russian Hill
US,"14.2%. Pretty. Char-toast, allspice, 5 spice, cola, tea, cocoa, dried cherry skin, pepper. In the mouth, a blast of sweet oak and cherry, but very dry. Rich, full-bodied, dry, sour cherry. Intricate. Fairly tannic. Sweet, cocoa-ey finish. Now - 2010.",East Block,93,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Lots of oak, vanilla and char aromas, mingled with cherry jam, cocoa and dusty spices. Very rich in cherries, oak and spices. Dry with firm, dusty tannins. Finishes long, rich and spicy. Full-bodied. Young, sappy, needs time. Best 2007 and beyond.",East Block,93,90,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"The problem here is a lack of fruit. Except for a hint of Chardonnay peaches and cream, you get little beyond alcohol and acidity. But it's a clean wine.",,82,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Quite bright on the palate, with firm tannins and pretty, zippy cherry, spice, tar, raspberry and herb flavors. The texture is a bit powdery but should calm down nicely with a little more bottle age.",,88,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Tin Barn
US,"Lots to like in this rich, peppery Syrah. It's a full-bodied, complex sipper, with subtlely earthy flavors of blackberries, blueberries, carob and figs. Good price for a wine of this polish.",Vanessa's Vineyard,88,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,River Road
US,"A few years in the cellar will soften and sweeten this fresh wine. Currently, it shows its youth with a tough dryness and acidity that give a resistant edge to the cherry, cola, root beer and new oak flavors. Hold until 2009; should develop complexity through 2011.",,88,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Olson Ogden
US,"Rochioli's estate Chard, as opposed to their single-vineyard or block bottlings, needs a really stellar year to shine. It's a very good wine, with crisp mineral, date and pineapple flavors, but lacks the richness and complexity that come with warmer vintages.",,88,50,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
US,"Too oaky for my tastes, this wine brims with spicy, smoky new-woody flavors and woodsap sweetness that overshadow the fruit. Aren't we past the toothpick stage?",,83,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lake Sonoma

US,"Dusty, young, a bit raw. Oozes Chinese five-spice, earth, wood, berry and oak aromas. Very fruity in the mouth, showing forward cherries and cocoa: almost candied, but very dry. Sappy, full-bodied, rich and jammy. Needs time. Drink 2006–2012.",Three Corner Vineyard,93,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"There's lots of rich acidity in this wine. It braces the tremendous pear and pineapple fruit and sweet oak, and lends the wine zest and structure. Finishes with a brilliant array of tangy spices.",Don Miguel Vineyard,90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Torres
US,"Not a success. The wine has a rustic feeling, and is so soft, it makes the cola and cherry flavors taste syrupy. Lacks life and vivacity.",Estate Grown,82,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WillowBrook Cellars
US,"This refreshing Chard keeps all its elements reined in for balance and charm. You'll find apple and peach flavors, subtle oak, crisp acidity and a touch of lees, all wrapped in a creamy texture.",Reserve,85,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood

US,"Denser, more tannic and fuller bodied than Lynmar's regular Pinot, which actually makes it less accessible. Showing notes of cherries and plums, as well as considerable oak. Tremendous spice in the finish. The richness, complexity and depth, not to mention tannins, suggest midterm aging. Hold until 2006.",Quail Hill Vineyard Quail Cuvee,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"13.5%. Very dry. Dusty. Tomato, cola, rhubarb, spice rub. Young. Sour cherry. Bone dry. Fairly big, tight, awkward now. Huge, angular. Needs a few years to soften and settle down.",Three Corner Vineyard,92,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Alcohol 14.2%. Still pretty tannic and youthful, with perky acids, and not showing at all its age. Big in fruit, with cherries and blueberries. Oak adds its thing, and there's a cocoa finish. No sign at all of raisins or overripeness. Beautiful now, and should hold throughout the decade.",Allen Vineyard,92,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Paler in color, lighter in body than most of his Russian River neighbors, and higher in acidity, this cherry-infused wine, with its voluptuous coating of oak, is more Pinot-like than the Syrah-like Pinots that are currently critics' darlings. In its youth, it seems awkward, even simple, but could be a keeper.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Shows aromas of cherries, dust, spices and oak, with a twiggy, earthy note. Tastes very fruity, sappy, jammy, thick and full-bodied. Bone dry, youthful and tannic. Immature. Should begin to come together after 2006.",West Block,92,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"After a dropoff in the quality of the '02, this wine marks a welcome return. Ripe and fruity in cherry and blueberry fruit, it's easy to enjoy now for its silky, oaky drinkability and classic structure. There are some superripe, raisiny flavors that add a piquant note, but I think this limits ageability.",Allen Vineyard,92,75,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Farrell likes to pick early, and thus trades opulence for acidity, elegance and possible ageworthiness. Here you'll find a tight, lemony wine, very crisp. The wine is marked by oak and lees, which add flavor and textural nuances, but it remains flinty and austere.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,90,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Made mainly from vineyards in Green Valley, the wine was barrel fermented and underwent complete malolactic fermentation. The French oak barrels were 50% new. This level of intervention was appropriate to the underlying wine, which is massive in tropical fruit, pear, fig and melon flavors. The result is complex and lush.",Dutton Ranch,94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"I love the delicate complexity of this Pinot, which is a blend of five vineyards along this famous wine trail. If you want to understand RRV Pinot, and particularly from the stretch they call the Middle Reach, study this wine. Dry, crisp and silky, it shows beautifully ripened cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate and spicy-herbal flavors, perfectly integrated with smoky oak, and the brilliant acid-tannin balance of a great vintage.",Westside Road Neighbors,93,65,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Shows lots of fine RRV Pinot character without a whole lot of complexity. The wine is elegantly silky and dry, with cherry, cola, pomegranate, rhubarb, herb tea and spice flavors. Drink now.",Scarlett,87,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,River Road
US,"Turning old, tired and funky, with dried leaf flavors and a tart, rasping finish. This Chard is just too old.",,81,10,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Buehler
US,"Dusty. Chinese black tea, blackstrap molasses, anise, allspice. Tons of spice rub, Chinese 5 spice, a hint of cherry. Mouth: Fruity sweetness that quickly recedes behind a wall of tannins. Spicy. Dried cherry, sour cherry candy. Rich, big, intricate, nuanced. Now - 2010.",West Block,91,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Doesn't show a lot of fruit, with citrus flavors just verging into tart green apples. Very clean and zesty with acidity, with oak shadings, it will be good with broiled salmon.",,85,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lake Sonoma
US,"Grown in the cool heart of the valley, but in a hot vintage, this beautifully ripe Pinot combines fruity power with elegant harmony to produce a delicious, complex wine. It's sturdy in acids and tannins, and bone dry. While the alcohol is high, it feels balanced and graceful. Best in its youthful flamboyance.",Saralee's Vineyard,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"The winemaker has crafted a tight, minerally, Chablis-style wine that's high in acidity. You won't find cascades of fruit or massive oak here, but tart citrus and green apple flavors and a firm, steely mouthfeel. Yet the wine possesses an undefinable quality of elegance. Cellar this for as long as you like.",,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"I love this for its absolute dryness and crispness and minerally depth. There's something coldly metallic in the taste and mouthfeel, and to the extent there's fruit, it's of grapefruits and lime zest, with a flowery exoticness. Sur lies aging and toasty new oak have added richness and layers of subtle nuance. Strikes you for the sheer excellence of its balance. Enjoy now–2010.",Kent Ritchie Vineyard,93,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"From the translucent, see-through ruby color to the intricate cola, cherry and toasted coconut flavors, this delicately powerful in a Burgundian way. Feels silky and light-bodied in the mouth, but there's nothing scanty about the wine's powerful intensity of fruit, spice and oak. Best now and for a couple of years.",Manzana Vineyard,92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Shows a beautiful balance of all its parts. The fruit is forwardly ripe, showing cherries, blackberries and rich dark chocolate. But the tannins are firm and supportive, and there's gorgeous acidity that makes the tastebuds sing. This is a really delicious young Syrah for the most upscale foods, and it's at its best now.",Trenton Station Vineyard,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"What great structure you get in this quintessentially food-friendly wine. Absolutely dry, it shows a crisp mineralityF to the pear, pineapple, toasted meringue and sweet, charry oak flavors, and the finish is amazingly deep and long. This is really an impressive Chardonnay.",,92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
US,"Has some ripe peach and pear fruit and an oaky veneer, but can't overcome its rustic mouthfeel. The tannins are apparent. Finishes bitter.",Acier,84,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau Felice
US,"I was struck by how pale this Pinot pours. It's a classic chilly-climate wine, light-bodied and elegant but complex, with cherry, raspberry, cola, rhubarb and cranberry sauce flavors that have been sweetened and vanilla-ized with oak. It's also superbly spicy, dusting the palate with cinnamon and dusty cocoa through a long, complete finish. Absolutely delicious.",Thomas Road,93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
US,"Earthy, simple and light, with modest cherry and herb flavors. Finishes dry, with a silky mouth feel.",,84,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alderbrook
US,"Young and strong now, with a dry mouthfeel and firm acidity and tannins, this fine Pinot should develop with age. The cherry, mocha, cola and rhubarb flavors are deep and long, and together with the silky texture, offer great pleasure. Drink now through 2010.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"I like the elegance, but it seems like it was rushed to market. It will certainly benefit from cellaring, as it's young and rude in acids right now, and not showing well. But there's something here in the vast heart of  cherries and pomegranates and overall balance. Should improve by the end of 2007, and hold for another five years.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,91,53,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"The cool vintage in this cool region has yielded a wine with grapefruit, lime and wildflower. There's no oak, so the fruit is front and center, along with vibrant acidity.",Shone Farm,86,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Benziger
US,"Most of the grapes came from esteemed Dutton vineyards. The wine is enormously ripe. The juice was barrel fermented and aged sur lie. Creamy, packed with tropical fruit and smoky vanilla flavors, it's hedonistically delicious, but almost as sweet as a dessert wine.",,86,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Girard
US,"In an era where size is everything, a wine like this makes you appreciate true balance. It has all the rich fruit, spice, cream and oak you could want in a Chard, but maintains elegance. So easy to drink, and yet so refined.","Reserve Speciale, Cuvee Michel Berthoud",92,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Arrowood
US,"Officially 13.0, but probably higher. Clear, vibrant. Cherry, cigar box/cedar, sweet-sour sauce, cola, soy, earth. Very dry, some sweet fruit remains, sour cherry, coffee, spice. Smooth, supple, silky, with a long, fruity finish. Will soften and sweeten through 2010, but an acquired taste.",West Block Reserve,90,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Absolutely lovely. Throws off complex cherry, rhubarb, cola and oak aromas, and then turns into the quintessence of cherry flavor, rich yet airy and lilting. Best consumed in its flashy, seductive youth.",Quail Hill Vineyard,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Big, juicy Pinot, dry and fruity, with layers of flavor that change with every sip. Black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, coffee, sweet tobacco, spice and oak all mingle in a myriad of sensations, finishing long and intense. Good now, but tannicly closed enough to warrant cellaring beyond 2007.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"Midnight black and drily astringent, this is not a wine to pop open tonight. But it's extraordinarily ripe and deep in black currants, with all kinds of earthy cocoa, balsamic, basil, Portobello, coffee and spice flavors. It will blossom and knit together with some time in the bottle. Best 2008–2011, at least.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A bit disappointing. Starts off with an exciting blast of cherry, cola, pomegranate and smoky vanilla aromas, but turns thin in the mouth, with only modest cherry and tamari flavors.",,86,39,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This interesting Chard strikes Chablisian notes in the mineral flavors that veer into apples, peaches and pineapples, and the high natural acidity. The wine trades opulence for a steely, structural elegance, and a complexity in the finish that fascinates.",Starr Ridge Vineyard,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Like most Chards these days, this wine is boldly flavored, oaky and rich. But it goes beyond the tropical fruits, vanilla and buttercream to achieve real finesse and elegance. The crisp acidity helps make it balanced.",Reserve,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Only 13 percent alcohol. Smells ripe and oaky. Red cherries, spices, root beer, cola. Touch of sweet beet. Nice balance of cherries and more herbal notes. Beautiful tannins, acids.",East Block Reserve,90,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Completely barrel-fermented, and it shows in the wine's lavish oak, ample weight and rich, oily texture. It's nutty and leesy, and much less overtly fruity than the winery's Russian River bottling, instead focusing more on weight and texture.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Pale, light-bodied, fruity and dry, this is the un-Cabernet, the red for white wine lovers. So easy to enjoy, you might overlook its complexities. Red cherries, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cinnamon and ginger candy, it's really delicious. Drink now for its freshness.",,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alderbrook
US,"Showing quite a bit of tannins and acids, this is a very young wine, of a kind that isn't seen all that much in Russian River Valley these days. Swan makes their Pinots the old-fashioned way, for aging. Dry and astringent, the wine has a deep core of cherry and blackberry fruit, almost like a Merlot, except for the silkiness. Stick this in your cellar until 2008, at least.",Great Oak Vineyard,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"My experience of Swan Pinots is that they've been made the same way for a long time, and require aging. This one shows some hard tannins and even some tough acids, although it's tremendous in cherry-pie filling, black raspberry and blackberry jam flavors. Right now it feels juvenile, rude, even rustic, but five to eight years in the cellar will reward.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Straddles the line between villages-type and premier cru Pinot. Light in color and body, one minute it seems simple and fruity, the next, it shows the complex dimensions of a fine young Burgundy. Hard to tell where it's headed, but it's a dry, crisp, silky wine, with lip-smacking cherry, cola and oak flavors.",Saralee's Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"This winery's '02 Pinot was very good. The '03 is even better. It's richer and more nuanced, offering savory flavors of cherries, coffee, sweet rhubarb pie, cola, cocoa and spice flavors that unfold in waves in the mouth. Dry and crisp, with some dusty tannins, this wine will be best in its tasty youth.",,90,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
US,"The Edwards style is big, ripe and rich, and this wine displays it in bold face. Although dry, it's massive in blackberries and cherries, melted milk chocolate, coffee and vanilla flavors. It has the richness of Syrah, without the tannins. This is a silky, complicated and enjoyable wine.",Olivet Lane Methode a L'Ancienne,90,54,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Alcohol a modest 13%. Smells “dry,” dusty-woody, briary. Bits and pieces of twigs, spices, anise, tomato, cola, rhubarb. Old Pinot, very dry and brittle. Some sweet cherries, sweet oak, vanilla, char. Delicate and refined, though big. Still some dusty tannins. Now-2008.",West Block Reserve,90,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Here's a likeable, complex Pinot, rich in varietal flavor and dry. The silky mouthfeel is elegant, while the cherry, cocoa, rhubarb and cola fruit is expressive and satisfying through the long, pepper-spicy finish. Drink now.",Reserve,90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Fairly big and full in the mouth, yet quite silky in texture, with supple tannins that softly frame flavors of cola, earth, raspberries and beets. Picks up dried-spice notes on the long finish.",Quail Hill Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"This is quite a mouthfilling Zin. From old vines, it's rich in flavor, with notes of blackberry jam, cassis, espresso, dark bitter chocolate and anise. It's on the soft side. A hefty amount of new French oak contributes sweet tannins and toast to this full-bodied, zesty wine.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,90,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"Rochioli's winemaker has crafted a fine, silky Pinot. The flavors veer toward red cherries and cola, with an edge of sweet oak, while acidity is tart. The wine finishes sharp, but should soften and improve with five to seven years in the cellar.",Rochioli Vineyard,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Castalia
US,"This first vintage of Calcaire made from Russian River Valley shows a hands-on wine much like when it hailed from Alexander Valley. Still the same heavy oak, with rich lemondrop and tropical fruit flavors. And still very tasty and drinkable.",Calcaire,89,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"There's a good Pinot in here waiting to get out, and three or four years may do it. Young and angular, with ripe cherry fruit and a rich earthiness suggesting sweet pipe tobacco, this well-oaked wine is dry, with an elegant, silky texture.",Rochioli Vineyard Le Pinot,89,80,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"A nice Cab that mingles its polished berry-cherry flavors with earthy tobacco and mocha to make for a dry, very drinkable wine.",OFS,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Loach
US,"Soft, slightly sweet and simple, this Syrah has fairly modest blackberry, licorice flavors and cola flavors. Drink now.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,85,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Rich in well-ripened fruit flavors and with a sweet coat of smoky oak and vanilla, this Chard also has a structural integrity based on crispness and vitality. It's not a soft, creamy Chard, but a firm one, with exotic fruit.",Reserve,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Frei Brothers
US,"This is a wine that need some age. Not a lot, but a few years for the edges to soften. It has some tannins and youthful acids, and an oaky veneer, that haven't integrated yet with the cherry and coffee fruit. A good sleep in a good cellar through 2007 or 2008 will do wonders.",Windsor Gardens,89,57,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dick Arrowood's Saralee's Viognier is consistently one of the best in California. Dependably ripe in juicy tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla flavors, it's balanced with acidity and minerals.",Saralee's Vineyard,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Arrowood
US,"This selection of five barrels (each representing one of Fritz's five daughters) is still lively, thanks to crisp acids that artfully point up flavors of cola, earth and black cherries. Smoke and earth on the nose. Drink now–2010.",Five Sisters,89,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"High in acidity and bone dry, this light-colored Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional right now, but I think it was released too early. It should gain momentum by the end of 2007, when the cherry, rhubarb and cola flavors become more integrated with the tannins and oak. If you have to drink it now, decant for several hours.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,89,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Another polished, succulent release from a vineyard that's not supposed to be warm enough to ripen Cabernet. Of course, the vintage was very good, and this effort shows upfront blackcurrant and leather flavors, with a long, fruity finish. It's generously oaked, and really excellent.",Rochioli Vineyard,90,42,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
US,"Turning brown and orange, and picking up old Pinot notes of dried cherries, potpourri, mocha and spice, in a very dry, silky, elegantly structured wine. Acids are bright. Pleasant, but not profound. Drink up.",Allen Vineyard,88,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Classic Russian River Pinot from a warm year. The wine is dry and crispy-soft, if that's not a contradiction, and the cherry and cola fruit is nearly raisined, but stops just short. The texture is all silk and satin. This wine is best consumed early. Drink now.",,89,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett
US,"Drinking well now, with smoke and earth aromas that easily slide into cola, black cherry and plum flavors. Plump in the mouth, but with crisp acids that may take over in another few years. Drink up.",Reserve,89,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Really young now, this vineyard block bottling needs a little time to come into its own. Tasted in February, a combination of acidity and bottle shock has made it brittle. But it's a very good wine, deliciously flavored, with a medium-bodied silkiness and Pinot's exotic sensuality.",Lot 4 Selection,88,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moshin
US,"This Sauvignon is very New Zealandy in gooseberry, green grass, alfalfa and citrus fruit. It's also totally dry, with good, crisp acids. It has a complex, layered creaminess that lifts it above the ordinary.",,88,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,White Oak
US,"I think this wine has a future, but right now it's in one of those middle-aged funks. It's ripe in cherries, bright in acids, and smooth, but has a certain flatness. It's a gamble, but check it out in another two or three years.",Allen Vineyard,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"A blend of half barrel-fermented wine with half tank-fermented, this is a ripe, fruit cocktail of a wine, blending tropical fruit with smoke, vanilla and citrus. Soft and easy to drink.",,89,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
US,"Excellent cool-country Cabernet at a good price. It has layers and layers of deep fruit, rich and chocolaty plum flavors, and an ultraplush mouthfeel. Some will adore its richness, while others may find it a bit too heavy and dusty, as the acids are hardly noticeable.",Hedin Vineyard,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Davis Bynum
US,"Very, very extracted, almost overwhelming in spearmint, fig and white pepper flavors, this wine leaves nothing to the imagination. It's big, but totally dry, and has a nice, clean brisk acidity.",,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
US,"The entry on this single-vineyard Chard is strangely neutral. It's not until the middle palate that a blast of sweet, vanilla-y toasty oak hits, and also pear, mango and spice flavors. From then on, it's a satisfying wine, rich and elegant.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"All of this is barrel-fermented, 45% in new French oak, and it shows in the toasty, nutty scents. Buttery and creamy on the palate, with a plump mouthfeel and layered flavors of ripe pears and dried spices. Long and pineapple-y on the finish.",Reserve,87,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"One of the first wines from De Loach after the Boisset takeover, this dry Gewürz is a good portent for the future. It's ultraclean and crisp, with very deep and satisfying flavors of Asian spices, peaches, litchi and citrus.",Early Harvest,87,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,De Loach
US,"Round, smooth and polished, this Pinot shows jazzy flavors of raspberries, cherries, mocha, vanilla and smoke. It's a tasty sipper, and has a light, silky mouthfeel.",,87,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"More herbal than Three Corner. Tomatoes, rhubarb, cola, not quite ripe. Anise, cocoa powder. Dry, brittle. Showing its age, but interesting and layered.",West Block Reserve,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Pretty tannic still, and very dry, but with some deep red cherry flavors, this wine may benefit from a few more years, but it's not an ager. It shows an angular structure that will stand up well to beef or lamb.",Rochioli Vineyard Le Pinot,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"From a very big vintage, a wine still with plenty of cherry and blackberry fruit, and even some gritty tannins. Very dry, and a little awkward in texture. Probably at its best now.",Allen Vineyard,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Plump and soft, with flavors that closely echo those found in the Quail Hill Vineyard bottling: spice, beet, earth, cola and cherries. Not as big as the Quail Hill, and not as long on the finish, but an attractive, easy-to-drink Pinot for near-term consumption.",,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"One of the few wines from this cooler Sonoma appellation in our tasting, and a nice one indeed. The aromas differ from the norm; there's spearmint, licorice gumdrops, herbs and tobacco. Nice and distinctive at all points: clean raspberry fruit, dusty tannins on the finish, and a peppery streak. A few years will bring it together even more.",OFS,90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Loach
US,"A bouquet of full, sweet fruit with attractive spice and earth accents and a rich creamy mouthfeel make this large-scale wine a real winner. Despite its plush qualities it has structure and some tannins to resolve. Already delicious, this should shine in three years. Cellar Selection.",Pelletti Ranch,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"“Black is Black” went the old song, and this Zin does too, with blackberries, black-pepper and dark-chocolate aromas and flavors galore. An impressive wine that shows full mouthfeel, and a long finish with dusty tannins. Editors' Choice.",Barbieri Ranch,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Cuts an elegant profile, with its ripe blackberry fruit and judicious use of oak. Supple and even, it shows good balance. The pepper, chocolate and licorice-tinged finish is long, with fine tannins. It's a big wine, but not awkward, showing depth and style.",OFS,90,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"A nice wine with real varietal character, a smooth mouthfeel, crisp acids and ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries and mocha. Try this as a first course leading up to the expensive stuff.",Angeline,86,10,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martin Ray
US,"Compared to the winery's Starr Ridge Chard from the same vintage, this is unassertive. It's thicker in the mouth, and softer, with a malted, custard texture framing peach flavors.",Westside Farms,86,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Dried cherry, cedar-toast and cumin notes mark the nose of this Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvingon-Merlot blend. It has a decidedly Tuscan cast to its sour-cherry-and-leather profile, and finishes dry, even and long, with hints of chocolate and plenty of toasty oak.",Splendo Blendo 1,89,80,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,De Loach
US,"Reserved, but with lovely aromatics, this Zin has tart dark-berry fruit and a slight nuttiness. Quite structured, this will benefit from a couple of years of cellaring.",Gambogi Ranch,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach

US,"Aromas of red berries with thyme and anise accents also show a whiff of acetone that bothered some tasters. After that, this wine is on very comfortable ground. Smooth and evenly textured, it has a balanced, even graceful quality often lacking in Zinfandels. Good length and mild pepper and spice mark the finish.",Estate Bottled,88,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Decidedly lighter in color and weight than the Barbieri Ranch wine, the Saitone shows a bouquet of tart cherries, strawberries and herbs. Anise-tarragon notes add interest on the textured palate. Closes with dry, talc-like tannins.",Saitone Ranch,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"Deeper and darker than the Estate bottling, this shows black cherry, meat and leather nuances. It's sexy, but a touch hot as well. Offers depth and complexity, especially on the finish, where interesting chocolate notes emerge.",OFS,88,44,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"You'll find a dry, crisp white wine, with modest citrus and figgy-melon flavors. But there are intriguing notes of fresh herbs sprinkled throughout, like lavender, thyme, anise and dill, which make this ideal for food pairing.",,87,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Mazzocco
US,"A little too porty and raisiny for my tastes. Drinking dry and somewhat tannic, although the alcohol is a modest 13.9 percent. Drink now.",Rochioli Vineyard Le Pinot,86,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
US,"Dark cherries, plums, olives and licorice, as well as an edgy, chemical note. Lean in style, the palate's mixed berry flavors have olive accents. Finishes long, with firm tannins and tart acidity.",Papera Ranch,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"A solid foundation of ripe dark-cherry fruit adds vanilla, toast and cinnamon accents that work to create a full bouquet and palate. This Pinot has character and complexity. Finishes long, with licorice and mineral elements playing off the dry cherry flavors. Editors' Choice.",Estate Bottled,87,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,The understated pear and pineapple flavors of this medium- weight Chardonnay have pleasant spice accents. It finishes stylishly with slightly tart pineapple and citrus notes.,,87,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Quite different from Spelletich's Spotted Owl release, this wine has spiced green-apple aromas. While it's as rich in flavor as the other offering, the acidity is lower, so the wine seems softer and creamier.",Heroncroft Vineyard-Keefur Ranch,86,29,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Spelletich Cellars
US,"Quite a bit more steely and structured than Fritz's regular Dutton Ranch bottling. Has strong green-apple and pear notes; pretty and harmonious. The fruit is ripe and spicy, and it's got enough oak trimmings to satisfy but not overwhelm.",Ruxton Vineyard Dutton Ranch,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"This wine has a flinty, minerally personality, with a full  overlay of toasty oak. Don't look for fat, blockbuster fruit here—the flavors tend toward lime and tangerine. The oak adds caramel, vanilla and smoky notes. It's supple in the mouth but closes strangely flat.",Family Vineyard Selection Del Rio Vineyard,84,21,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Louis M. Martini
US,"Likeable for its gentle, easy texture, silky tannins and ripely pleasant flavors of cola, cherries, coffee, spices and smoky oak. Almost the perfect restaurant by the glass wine, tasty and versatile.",Dutton Ranch,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastopol
US,"Even tasted from magnum, this wine is starting to show its age, revealing smooth tannins and a slightly thinning texture. Meaty notes add spice to the beet and earth aromas and flavors. Drink up.",Quail Hill Vineyard,87,,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar

US,"Complex, with pears, sweet grass, apples, citrus, jasmine, and chalk all apparent on the nose. Creamy and full in the mouth, like a good milkshake. Some toast notes come on at the end.",Dutton Ranch,87,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
US,"Taut and intensely structured, the compact smoke, lime, ginger and nut bouquet here hints at what's within. The mouth offers lime and chalk, vanilla and apples and a creamy yet firm mouthfeel—it's surprisingly full, with bright acidity. The dry, crisp finish with its spicy, toasty flavors has great length, again showing structure and refinement. Will be at its best in two-plus years. Cellar Selection.",Woolsey Road Vineyard,92,37,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"Full and focused, the nose of orange, crème brûlée and vanilla opens to a handsomely balanced palate of lively citrus, Granny Smith apple and vanilla cream flavors. Moderately plump and pleasing, good underlying acidity here keeps it elegant and maintains fine flavor definition. Butterscotch, lemon and spicy oak flavors mingle on the long finish.Top Value.",Goldfields Vineyard - Reserve,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Deep pineapple and orange fruit is wrapped in a deep, toasty oak envelope in this Russian River classic. There are complex nutty, leesy, burnt sugar and even vaguely meaty notes on the nose. These open to a big-bodied but earthy and stony palate where bright, citrusy fruit and vanilla accents also vie for attention. Tightly wound, the burnt-toast and mineral finish is long and tasty, with more vanilla, smoke and apple accents. Top Value.",,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dehlinger
US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",,91,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cakebread
US,"At 2,523 cases, this is fabled grower Rochioli's largest-production Chardonnay. The bouquet sings with complex roasted nut, pineapple, citrus, toast and banana aromas. Tart apple and anise flavors play off the sweet caramel and vanillin oak to create an elegant balance on the palate. Persistent fruit and smoky accents on the finish—it's hard to resist. Top Value.",Estate,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli

US,"This shows winemaker Greg LaFollette's master touch in the way he's balanced the wine and kept it harmonious. It's a huge mouthful of cherry pie and cassis flavor, with the most delicate notes of raspberries, toasted meringue and vanilla, subtlely spiced and dry. A gorgeous Pinot Noir that superbly combines power with elegance.",30th Anniversary Cuvee,96,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"There's plenty of apple, melon, and citrus fruit in this dry, stylish wine. Has a nice earthy streak that hits midpalate, then turns ripe and generous on the finish. It's a little on the simple side, but it's pretty good for the price.",,85,11,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Trellis
US,"An intoxicating bouquet of clove, ripe orange, peach and melon promises a lot, but this wine delivers. The similarly heady palate of creamy, ripe tropical fruit is almost romantic, the richly textured mouthfeel full and lush. Finishes long in the same sensuous manner. Drink now for its exuberant fruit and voluptuous feel. Like Paul, his wines exude style and character.",,91,38,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paul Hobbs
US,"This appealing Chardonnay is the same wine that carried a reserve designation in prior vintages. It's lushly woven and has aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and peach. The fruit is rich but not overly sweet, and sports accents of cinnamon and allspice. This balanced, medium-weight wine finishes long and easy with a nice nuttiness. Top Value.",,90,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"No oak in this wine, but it's amazingly rich anyway. The wine is very dry, with Meyer lemon flavors boosted by a firm minerality and rich acidity. Absolutely defines the unoaked style of Sauvignon Blanc.",Shone Farm,94,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Benziger
US,"The vineyard is in the cool, far western part of Green Valley, and the wine, which never saw oak, has very high acidity, nearly 7.7 g/L. You might expect it to be lean, even feline, but the Duttons, among the best growers in the country, have produced a rich, fruity wine, dry and complex in apricot, citrus, herb and mineral flavors. This is simply a tremendous food wine.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,93,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
US,"This is a unique wine with an unusual and impressive bouquet of peach smoke, cocoa and hazelnut. Balanced but firm on the palate, it offers robust fruit and spice flavors and mint, toast and nut accents. There's even an intriguing kirsch-like cherry note in here. Full-bodied, it's a wine of real individual character that finishes dense, long and spicy.",Don Miguel Vineyard Dobles Lías,90,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Torres
US,"Four different clones are separately fermented and then blended to make this unique bottling. An expansive nose shows vibrant pineapple, peach, and orange fruit with lemondrop and butterscotch accents. It's rich and mouthfilling, like a bite of banana cream pie, and turns maybe a bit orangey-sweet. Shy on subtlety, it packs in a lot of juicy flavor.",Three Jacks Vineyard,89,33,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.",OFS,89,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Not much going on. Clean and dry, with watery flavors of apples and oak.",Indindoli Vineyard,83,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Waugh Cellars
US,"Always a rewarding wine, this year's Etoile is particularly rich. It floods the palate with complex fruit spanning the gamut from lemons and limes to pineapples and guavas. Barrel fermentation lends a creamy texture, while the cool climate gives the wine the acidity it needs for balance.",La Petite Etoile Vineyard,92,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Most of the grapes are from the winery's original 1959 planting. It's a beautiful, refined Sauvignon Blanc, brimming with lemon and lime, freshly mowed green grass and tangy green apple flavors. Partial barrel fermentation adds a creamy complexity. The wine is totally dry and bright in acidity, but it's really the fruit that stars.",,92,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
US,"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further.",,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"One of the ripest Farrell Pinots I've ever tasted, this bottling, from the well-known Allen Vineyard, is enormously fruity. It was a very hot, fast vintage, and the fruit here is enormously rich, almost dessert-like in baked cherry pie and rum-soaked currant flavors. It is, however, fully dry. Drink this decadent Pinot with beef tenderloin served in a wine or fruit reduction sauce.",Allen Vineyard Hillside Blocks,92,60,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine. It's a decidedly candy-sweet combination of butterscotch, peach and nut flavors with a soft, round mouthfeel. The light orange finish is easy. If you have good friends who just don't like dry wines, this is a great one to serve them.",Reserve,88,32,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ledson
US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality. Has all the body and length you could want, if not quite all the balance and finesse.",Rochioli Vineyard,87,34,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
US,"Some very appealing apple, asian pear, mint, smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even, medium-weight wine. It has fine fruit-to-acid balance and offers apple-peach flavors with a mild but evident butterscotch element. The tangy oak that's present from the start shows most prominently on the spicy finish.",,87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rudd
US,"This smooth wine has good balance, and a fairly full mouthfeel. Even on the palate, it shows a bit of both ends of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum—the crisp grassy, herb and grapefruit side and also fig, pear and melon as foundation.",,86,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Right out there on the border of superripe, in fact almost sweet, but carefully avoids a sugary finish. Still, it's abundantly rich in blackberry and fruity-tea flavors that are dry in the most technical sense.",Reserve,84,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frei Brothers
US,"Acorn persists with this Italian variety despite the challenges. It's dry and medium-bodied, with a silky texture and some hot acids. The flavors are of cherries and tobacco. Overall, it's a clean country wine.",Alegria Vineyards,84,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Dolcetto,Acorn
US,"This is a wine made for the cellar. It's dark, and smells rich, with ripe blackberry and plum fruit and a hefty dose of vanilla-scented, smoky oak. Full-bodied, but the tannins are hefty now, and the acidity is high. Probably best to put it away for four or five years and see what happens.",Laureles,89,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Davis Bynum
US,"Bright berries are all dressed up in cedary, pencil-like oak and kissed with velvety black-tea and creamy chocolate notes that linger through the finish. Closes a bit lean, probably a function of the less-than-stellar vintage, but a solid effort.",Lone Oak Vineyard,87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Rosenblum
US,"From a venerable Burgundian producer comes this earthy, spicy wine, with a body and texture that are unctuous and creamy. There's a whole fruit basket here, with everything from green apples to peaches to tropical fruit. What's harder to express is the wine's power to satisfy. Rich and lush, it swings for the bleachers and just misses, but it's a solid triple. Editors' Choice.",Mariage,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martin Ray
US,"Wow. This is one big, impressive Sauvignon Blanc. It's the grass and gooseberry, and the acidity. The wine hits the palate like a bomb, dry and crisp and explosive. Mid-palate, the fruit emerges, peaches, figs, melons, limes, kiwi. This is De Loach's first OFS Sauvignon and it's worthy of the designation.",OFS,91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,De Loach
US,"If the grapes were any riper, they'd be doing chin-ups in the glass. A blast of pungent peach, green apple and cantaloupe notes is accented by new oak. That power carries over to the flavors. It might almost be too ripe for food. Definitely in the California style, like it or not.",,87,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Philip Staley
US,"Very pale in color, just beyond rose. Wonderfully fragrant aromas of black cherries, cola, Oriental spices, smoke and mushroomy earth. It packs a real punch in the mouth, too, with a great depth of rich, fruity, spicy flavor. Dry, with soft tannins but lively acidity.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rutz
US,"A rich, complex Chardonnay with apple and peach notes and a strong mineral component. A scent of something like gunmetal or flint follows through in the flavors and helps give the wine a steely backbone. A distinctive wine; very dry and crisp.",,87,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rutz
US,"This Napa winery has been reaching into the Russian River for their Chardonnay, with good results. Dry and crisp in acids, the wine has a minerality behind the green apple, peach and melon flavors. The firm structure should provide for aging through 2009.",,89,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Girard
US,"This wine preserves the region's vital characteristics (well-ripened fruit and spice), although they've been diluted by necessity for commercial purposes, what with 28,000 cases produced. Light and soft, with delicate yet surprisingly delicious black-raspberry, smoke and cinnamon notes.",,86,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"This is a balanced, easy to drink Chardonnay, with citrus, peach and green apple flavors that have been finished with a veneer of smoky oak. It's totally dry. Do not overchill it, as it's a delicate wine that needs some warmth to open up.",OFS,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Acorn, which does such interesting things with Rhône varieties, shows it's no slouch with Bordeaux varieties, to judge from this fresh, succulent young red wine. It's medium-bodied and dry, with polished flavors of cherries, blueberries, leather and herbs and a long, spicy finish.",Alegria Vineyards,88,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Acorn
US,"From Domaine St. George, a polished, ripe wine, from a premier growing region. It's dry and a little rough in texture, with complex flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, and a cleansing espresso bitterness to the finish.",,86,14,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,STG
US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",Mills Vineyard,86,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.",Hopkins Vineyard,86,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"Very ripe in the mouth, with mounds of black cherry and mocha flavors, this Pinot has a full-bodied, slightly heavy feeling. It's dry and silky, and a nice example of a good Russian River Pinot from a warm vintage.",,85,18,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
US,"Siduri's basic Russian River bottling is very ripe in fruit, heavy in texture and soft, with a cherry, coffee and chocolate syrup flavor. It's as tasty as a candy. Drink now.",,84,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking.",Alegria,91,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"All the components of fine Zinfandel are in top form here, from the opening fat, dark berry aromas to the deep, sweet fruit on the smoothly textured palate and the lovely fruit-acid balance. Closes handsomely, with full even tannins and some white pepper on the long back end. Drinks well now and has the structure to last and improve for a few years as well.",Collins Vineyard,90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Limerick Lane
US,"Firm, tannic and fruity, with some nice tropical fruit flavors, wrapped around stiff tannins and some green, slightly stemmy flavors. The finish is hard and rough.",,85,16,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Castle
US,"The nose of this Russian River Valley, single-vineyard offering shows positive dark berry fruit bearing mild meaty accents.  Made in a lighter style, the flavors follow the aromatic opening and the wine finishes dry with medium tannins, red berry and tea notes.",Ricci Vyd,85,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mayo
US,"A very distinctive Chard—full of character and even eccentricity. There are strong, up-front aromas of tangerines, vanilla, butterscotch, smoke, ripe peaches and caramel. It's especially notable for the thick, creamy texture and a penetrating, spicy clove note that follows through on the long, rich finish. A complex, serious wine.",Shop Block Vineyard Dutton Ranch,91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure.",Ruxton Vineyard,89,27,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",Dutton Vineyard,87,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
US,"Grassy and dull, this white tastes diluted and is lacking in flavor. The few decipherable notes lean toward fresh-cut lime.",Kick Ranch,83,30,California,Sonoma,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Delectus
US,"Clean, thin, bone dry, and crisp. That about says it all for this simple, inexpensive wine. It's quite tart and lemony-chalky, and will do just fine with shellfish, appetizers, or as an aperitif.",,84,10,California,Sonoma,Sonoma,Pinot Grigio,Forest Glen
US,"Plenty of flavor packed into this modest little blush, which smacks of ripe peaches and strawberries. A bit of sugar balances out the high acidity, leading to a soft, semi-sweet aftertaste.",,84,12,California,Sonoma,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Forest Glen
US,"The producer sources from two blocks of the vineyard for this wine—one at a high elevation, which contributes bright acidity. Crunchy cranberry, pomegranate and orange peel flavors surround silky, succulent layers of texture that present as fleshy fruit. That delicately lush flavor has considerable length.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,95,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blue Farm
US,"This fresh and lively medium-bodied wine is beautifully crafted, with cherry blossom aromas and tangy acidity. Layered and seductive, it offers a crisp mix of orange peel, cherry, pomegranate and baking spice flavors that are ready for the table or the cellar.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,95,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell

It's a tight, light and minimally messed-with wine, bright in cherry, pomegranate and rose.",,91,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Red Car
US,"Focused streaks of high-acidity lemon and a low oak profile combine for a refreshing take on Chardonnay, the other components coming together in swathes of fennel and brine. The wine finishes with a hit of power.",,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Super earthy, in the classic damp forest-floor way, this also offers hints of menthol, eucalyptus and tomato leaf. The wine begins light bodied, but builds up power and weight as it goes. Layered with black cherry and plum, it's dark and savory.",Sonatera Vineyard,88,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"This is such a good Pinot, and so reflective of the Sonoma Coast, that its price makes it a steal. With low alcohol and brisk acidity, it's translucent in color, with a gleaming ruby hue. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink now–2020.",,92,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Les Voleurs
US,"Tropical guava and mango surround a restrained cradling of French oak, only 15% of it new, in this easy-to-like, approachable wine. Wrappings of vanilla and honeysuckle complete the picture, with a straightforward, relatively lengthy finish.",Signpost,90,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Trig Point
US,"Cloudy, pungent and supremely earthy, this wine reveals its delicate acidity over time, bringing balance to its flamboyant fruit. With intense strawberry, orange peel and black tea flavors, it's savory and richly built, finishing on a touch of smoky vanilla.",Rogers Creek,93,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Cherry Pie
US,"Here's a big Pinot Noir, dark, dense and tannic. In part, those tannins are due to 30% whole-cluster fermentation, which also gives the wine a brooding earthiness and spiciness. Fully dry, it's packed with black cherry, rhubarb and pomegranate fruits. Hold it until 2018 and see how it's doing.",Rodgers Creek Vineyard,91,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Les Voleurs

Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves.",Sangiacomo Green Acres Hill,90,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Eric Kent
US,"This wine is sourced from a handful of stellar vineyards, including Pratt, Dutton, Sullivan and Chenoweth. It was given 18 months in French oak, all of it twice-used or older, which contributes to an integrated, understated wood presence that's refreshing in its restraint. Creamy acidity and a taste of baked bread cradles lemon zest and almond before a crisp, lengthy finish.",,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Pitchoune
US,"This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine. The fruit tends dark and brooding, with a brambly character balanced against the crispness of acidity. The spiciness persists through the finish.",Geza's Selection,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Buena Vista
US,"This is balanced and elegant in subtle pear, ginger and lemon. A fine food wine, it's ideal for roast chicken in herbes de Provence or ratatouille.

US,"Wild strawberry and a thicket of dense tannin belie a powerfully strong and elusive wine, still very much tightly wound, indicative of the vintage. A portion (35%) of the grapes were whole-cluster pressed, from tight-spaced, low-yielding vines. A little more oak was used than in most of the producer's other wines, helping to impart a spicy finish.",MK Vineyard,90,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines

US,"Complex and well balanced, this wine shows enticing aromas of fruits, spices and subtle herbs followed by tangy, dry, and slightly lean flavors like cranberry and rhubarb.

US,"Blended from several stellar vineyard sites, including La Cruz and Devoto, this wine presents a brightness of acidity and crisp, red fruit.

US,"If you can only cellar one Sonoma Pinot Noir from the 2011 vintage, make it this one. It's a big, tight wine with strong tannins, but somehow never loses sight of Pinot's essential delicacy.

The deliciousness factor is high, but right now, it's all about intense, primary flavors of red plums, rasberries and mulberries framed within bold oak and tannins (in part due to partial whole-cluster fermentation).

US,"With tight acidity like a squeeze of lemon and a lightness of being, this Pinot can be described as elegant rather than opulent. The feral, exotic flavors of pine cones, wild herbs, tea, raspberries and cola suggest the Fort Ross area. There's an exciting complexity and challenge to this wine.

US,"This wine comes from a vineyard planted in the early 2000s in the Sebastopol Hills by Charlie Chenoweth for the Jenkins family, a country music trio consisting of Nancy Jenkins and her two daughters. It is inviting and seductive in black cherry and baking spices. Tightly wound, it has nuance and a lingering afterthought of savory pepper and meat.",Jenkins Ranch,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Dark burgundy in color, it has an old-world soul, earthy and brooding in clove, mushroomy forest floor and a light texture of cherry, not what you'd expect from a big-time NASCAR guy. Restrained yet powerful.",,90,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Jeff Gordon
US,"This wine is ripe and simple, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors, but it's clean and vibrant in acidity. The blend is Pinot Noir, Syrah and Grenache.",,84,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Rosé,Burt Street Cellars
US,"A bit tough and gritty, with a less-than-ripe green tomato flavor alongside the notes of cherry and pomegranate. Oaky richness adds sweetness and texture to this wine. It's not going anywhere, but the acid-tannin structure and minerality are pleasurable. Give it a decant and enjoy.",Stony Point Vineyard Estate,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,James Family Cellars
US,"The Damaris Chardonnay has varied in grape sourcing over the years, ranging from Santa Maria Valley to Sonoma Valley. But with this new Sonoma Coast bottling, the wine has hit new heights. It's dry, brisk in acidity and tantalizing, with citrus and tropical fruit notes.",Damaris Reserve,92,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Landmark
US,"Subtle aromatics of earthy rose petal surround this silky, light wine, steeped in acidity and a damp-forested quality. Spicy throughout in cinnamon, cardamom and grated nutmeg, the wine picks up a girth of thickness on the finish, a knot of tannin that gives it a swath of complexity and cellaring possibilities, through 2018.",Whistler Vineyard,92,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Dense packed earth and a wild edge make for a complex experience in this vineyard-designate, from a hilltop site tended by fellow vintner and grape grower, Steve MacRostie. Blackberry, plum and herb flirt around light-bodied layers of black tea, with a finish of high-strung black cherry.",Wildcat Vineyard,92,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Gets the Chardonnay job done effectively, offering flavors of orange, papaya, buttered toast, caramel, cream and vanilla honey. Pretty simple, but the price is right for what you get.",Lot #7,84,15,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tangley Oaks
US,"Ripe, jammy fruit, tart acidity and oak are pretty much what you get here. It's pretty simple and perhaps should be better than what it is.",,84,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Burt Street Cellars
US,"This has traditionally been a top bottling for Sojourn, and the 2011 is especially good. The vibrant acidity and pineapple, tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors are intense and pure. Drink it now and over the next three years.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sojourn
US,"This is a fine, ageable Pinot Noir that's dry and crisp with acidity. It exhibits a mushroomy earthiness that frames strawberry, cranberry and cola flavors. The window of drinkability begins in 2015.",Camp Meeting Ridge Block 11,92,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers

US,"Made in a Méthode Champenoise style from well-farmed vineyards, this Blanc de Blancs is sharp in acidity and biting flavors of green apple and lemon zest. Crisp and fresh, it's also complex and slightly brooding, weaving in waves of brioche and almond as it goes.",Sangiacomo Road Vineyard Blanc de Blancs,93,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Foundry
US,"Stemmy earth and dark, savory pine give in to sautéed mushroom and cinnamon in this lean, soft and delicious estate-grown wine. A tension of acidity buoys a backdrop of wild strawberry and cranberry on the palate, ending with just the right amount of weight and length, succulent to the end.",Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown,93,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Phelps
US,"Turbine Red has 45% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 28% Mourvèdre. A burst of bright strawberry fruit focuses around a smooth mouthfeel of more black and red fruit and still-grippy tannins. The finish enters into more classic Syrah and Mourvèdre territory, with leathery, earthy layers nicely intermingling.",Turbine,90,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Rhône-style Red Blend,Anaba
US,"Rich and thick, this is an opulent offering of dark cherry and Asian spice, the spice popping on the palate throughout the long finish. Full bodied, it nonetheless features crisp, balanced acidity and a taste of rosemary and lavender, the perfect companion to a butterflied lamb seasoned the same.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"A heady mixture of lemon custard and baked pear marks the entry to this full-bodied, deliciously decadent wine, from a high-elevation site above the Petaluma Gap. Honeyed aromas maintain themselves in the glass, accented in floral honeysuckle and ginger. Lovely and generous, it softens as it goes.",Sunchase Vineyard,93,68,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pellet Estate
US,"From the cooler reaches of the Petaluma Gap, a sub-area of the larger Sonoma Coast that is awaiting its own appellation status, this Pinot was made with 25% whole-cluster berries, giving it a rough-hewn, earthy edginess that's appealing in the glass. Tightly wound cherry and cranberry complete the picture, with a taste of dried herb and black tea on the lengthy finish.",Spring Hill Vineyard,91,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Waxwing
US,"Nothing charming about this wine, which is sweet, acidic and fruity, like a Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy. Pretty expensive for what you get.",Charm Acres,83,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"A ripe Pinot Noir—it's a little forward and jammy, but its acids and tannins are well balanced. Oak is there in the background, bringing subtle toast influence to the cherries and pomegranates. Drink now–2015.",Otelia's Selection,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Buena Vista
US,"This is a softly appealing yet ultimately simple wine. It's flamboyant in flavor, suggested buttered white toast, spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with cinnamon. Ready now.",Corona Creek Vineyard,85,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stomping Girl
US,"Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.",Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block,91,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"A bone-dry Chardonnay for drinking now. This shows great structure, with a keen cut of acidity that brightens the mineral-driven orange and pineapple flavors.",,90,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"A proper, textbook Pinot Noir—it's dry, nicely crisp, with smoothly astringent tannins. It has pleasant, complex cherry, pomegranate, plum, tobacco, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Not an ager, so drink up with upscale fare.",,90,27,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
US,"A dazzlingly good Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the precision of flavor and structure. Shows the massively ripe character of the vintage, with a starburst of raspberries, cherries, cola, minerals and spices, while the acidity and tannins are just about perfect. This crowd pleaser is just extraordinary now, and should develop in the bottle over the next six years.",Precioso,95,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.",Precioso,95,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak. Packed with raspberries and cherries, the wine is completely dry and firm in minerals, and seems easily able to age for at least six years. Only 120 cases were produced.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,94,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.",,91,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Dark for a blush wine, with a crimson hue, and forward and heavy in flavor, too. Shows red cherries, root beer and spices that are accented with brisk acidity, and finish dry. Not very complex or subtle, but easy with all kinds of summer fare.",Fort Ross Vineyard Rosé,86,14,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"This is rich and oaky, with ripe orange, pineapple and pear flavors and the buttered toast of oak barrel aging. Almost too much of a good thing, it trades nuance for sheer power, but it's certainly a good example of the California style.",Bicentennial Commemorative Bottling,89,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"Anyone who doesn't love this Pinot just doesn't understand California's approach. It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity. Just beautiful, and it grows better as it warms in the glass. Probably not an ager, but wonderful now and through 2013.",Burnside Vineyard,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Another terrific wine from this vineyard, following the superb '07. May be a bit less flamboyant, but with better structure, and equally ageable. Dry and full bodied and fairly tannic, it shows powerful cherry and raspberry fruit, smoked meat, sautéed wild mushroom and sandalwood flavors, liberally spiced. Drinkable now, and should develop through 2014, at least.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"Keller enters the big leagues with this marvelously layered Pinot Noir. For starters, it's delicious. Dry and crisp, the flavors are of ripe cherries, raspberries, tangerines, pomegranates and cola, with smoky, spicy complexities from new French oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, leading to a long, fruity finish. Best now and through 2010.",La Cruz Vineyard,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"Very ripe, in fact, shows signs of overripeness in the raisiny notes accompanying the plums and coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy and Syrah-like, but with a silky texture. Good wine but needs more delicacy and breed.",Andreen-Gale Cuvee,87,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"With briary, brambly flavors of wild cherries, blueberries and peppery spices, this is a rugged wine. Its tannins are a bit harsh. Could age, but right now, it's not showing much sophistication.",Fort Ross Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinotage,Fort Ross
US,"This young, impetuous Pinot Noir needs time in the cellar to calm down. It's all about fresh acidity of the citrus kind and ripe, jammy cherry and raspberry fruit, not to mention sweet, unintegrated oak. Give it a good four years.",,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kanzler
US,"Displays classic cool climate character in the stimulating acids and brisk tannins. Is it a cellarworthy wine? Probably not. There's blackberry and cherry fruit, but this dry, elegant wine isn't built for the long haul.",,87,29,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is an astonishing value, especially from such a prestigious appellation. Has a silky texture and lush but dry flavors of cherries, raspberries, herbs, mushrooms, coffee and clove that unfold across the palate. Versatile at the table; try with pork tenderloin with plum sauce. With more than 30,000 cases produced, this should be easy to find.",Reserve,90,8,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Intellectual, elusive and challenging, this wine makes you think. It's dry, silky and crisp in acidity, with complex mushroom, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. It's also a little rustic, but time could help. If you're a gambler, hold it until after 2015.",Stuller Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Boheme
US,"The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a wind tunnel you'll be hearing more about as the source of cool-climate wines. This lusty Syrah is enormously fruit-forward in cherries, blackberries, coffee, beef carpaccio and peppery spice flavors, an exuberant wine balanced with crisp acids. Drink now through 2009.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"Made in a light-bodied, lower-alcohol style, this Pinot feels silky and gentle in the mouth. It really delivers when it comes to flavor. Displays big, impressive notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood that are complex and satisfying, and that finish entirely dry. Drink now and over the next four years.",La Cruz Vineyard,92,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"What's so nice about this Chardonnay is the way the dryness, acidity and minerality combine with tropical fruit to make for a splendid, Chablis-style California wine. It's a connoisseur's Chardonnay, requiring some understanding of structure. Don't drink it too cold; could even stand a brief decant at room temperature.",,91,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,91,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Expression 38
US,"Pretty cherry flavors lead the way, framed in subtle herb notes.  But the tannins are rough, and the finish a bit short and tart.",,82,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",,90,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Expression 38
US,"Marked by big, sharp acidity, like biting into a lime, and clean, linear flavors of limes, green apples and pineapples, this bone-dry Chardonnay badly needs food to balance it out. Think of bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, or a spicy Ahi tuna tartare dish.",,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"This is enormously rich in berry, cherry and cola flavor. It's flashy, but not particularly subtle as a Pinot Noir should be, and it veers on being a little heavy.",Terra de Promissio,88,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"Bone dry, firm in tannins and tartly acidic, this wine feels hard in the mouth. It shows flavors of cherries and cola, with a leathery finish. Elegant in structure, it may soften and sweeten over the next five years.",Stagecoach Vineyard,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"Shows rich, racy acidity in a dry wine whose flavors veer toward ripe pineapple-tart filling, cinnamon spice and butterscotch, wrapped in a creamy texture. Would score far higher if the fruit were more concentrated.",,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
US,"A challenging wine. It's rather strong and dry and extracted now, lacking delicacy, and makes you want to stick it in the cellar for a while. Yet there's a certain hollowness that may limit ageability. If you drink it now, give it a good decant.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"One of the richer Pinots out there, just packed with ripe raspberries and cherries, like the filling in a pie. Shows great, cool-climate acidity, and the texture is as light and silky as can be. Defines the best of a drink-now style.",,89,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"Ripe and oaky, with notes of vanilla and buttered toast dominating pineapple and tropical fruit flavors. Brisk acidity provides a needed balance to all this richness.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jenner
US,"Very dry and pretty tannic, this cool-climate Syrah combines its blackberry and cherry fruit with less ripe notes of herbs and even a touch of asparagus. Intense umami flavors of salty, smoky bacon give it richness. Drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,88,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"Schug has three new Pinots out. This is the lightest and easiest. It's pale, delicate and silky, with easy cherry, cola, vanilla and spice flavors. Your basic Pinot for beginners.",,85,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
US,"The grapes simply got too ripe, and the wine suffers from sugary-sweet cherry jam flavors with baked  meringue, courtesy of well-charred oak. Those flavors are of course delicious, but the wine is direct and unageable.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,85,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Could use greater acidity and structure to provide a framework for all the fruit, but that fruit sure is attractive. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with pretty additions from smoky oak. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",,87,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Guarachi Family
US,"With rich, spicy raspberry, cherry, tangerine zest and sweet cola flavors, wrapped into a silky texture, this is a pretty, polished Pinot to drink now. Zesty acidity makes for a mouthwatering crispness. Good with ahi tuna tartare.",,88,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista

US,"This Cabernet-Syrah blend is made in a lighter, more acidic and earthier style than most red wines these days. With only 13.9% alcohol, it shows crisp flavors of dried cherries, tobacco, black pepper and sandalwood. Needs a good decant.",Dei Du Rocchi Ranch Fog Line,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Red Blend,Old World
US,"Dark in color, soft in structure and rather heavy, this is a good Pinot Noir that doesn't quite rise beyond a drink-me-now polish. It has jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries and mocha. Drink now.",,87,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards
US,"This is a dry, minerally and acidic Chardonnay, with just enough of a squeeze of lemon and lime to satisfy. Drink this austere wine with roast chicken, broiled halibut and vegetable tempura.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sanglier Cellars
US,"Rather strong and direct now, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. Although the wine is dry, it tastes sweet in caramelly oak and fruity extract as well as glycerine. It's a rich, flashy wine, but lacks some subtlety.",Jenkins Ranch,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall

US,"Heavy and sweet, this wine has melted cherry-jam and Dr. Pepper flavors and some heat from the alcohol.",,84,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Jeff Gordon
US,"Pinot Noir just doesn't get richer than this. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries, with fascinatingly earthy things, like truffles and pine cones. Vibrant acidity and a hint of furry tannins give it a fine structure. This upscale Pinot Noir is drinkable now and should evolve over the next six years.",Durell Vineyard,94,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Two-plus years in the cellar have softened and mellowed this wine, taking off the edges and giving it a nice roundness. It's quite impressive, filled with classically varietal cherry, cola and sweet persimmon fruit, while that famous Russian River acidity gives it a boost of tartness. Drink this delicious, rich wine now–2016.",Le Roi,93,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Lots of oak on this five-year-old Syrah. Too much, in fact, although it may be that the cherry-berry fruit is simply dropping out. Either way, it's a fairly simple wine, dry and tart and spicy. Drink now.",Coryelle Fields Vineyard,86,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Tin Barn
US,"Some will critique this Pinot as too big and bold, but it defines the ripe, exuberant California style. It's fabulously rich in berry fruit, mocha and spice flavors. Nothing shy about it, and not particularly subtle in its appeal, but it does show meticulous vineyard care and terroir. Its future evolution is unclear, but this delicious Pinot Noir is a natural partner to full-bodied lamb and beef dishes.",Clos Madeleine,92,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Notre Vin
US,"This is a rich, delicious and balanced Pinot. It defines the modern California style, being dry, silky and ripe, showing a wealth of raspberry, cherry, cola, persimmon and spice flavors. Oak adds rich notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Drink this savory wine over the next few years.",No. 7 Sonoma Collection,91,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,JCB
US,"A heavy, dense Pinot that, despite considerable cherry, raspberry, strawberry and pomegranate fruit richness, feels a bit inert on the palate. Drink now.",,85,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Verve
US,"Succeeds in playing the Chardonnay card just where consumers want it. With some new oak, it's packed with tangerine, apricot, green apple and peach flavors, made brisk by acidity, and finished with honeyed ripeness.",,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Rich and tangy, a Chardonnay that appeals for its pure varietal flavors and noble structure. It's powerful in pineapple and orange fruit, with a sweet overlay of caramelized oak. This richness is balanced by brisk acidity and minerality.",No. 76,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,JCB
US,"Dazzles with richness, offering waves of candied, tart raspberry and cherry fruit, Dr. Pepper, exotic Indian spice, rose petal and sandalwood flavors, as well as undefinable feral things. Absolutely dry and high in acidity, with overwhelming complexity, it's a milestone. Drink now through 2014; could go way beyond.",Hirsch Vineyard,97,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Lots of zesty, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. The pineapple, crème brûlée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors are so rich that they require balance, which the zippy acidity provides. Maybe a touch too oaky, but that's a matter of personal preference.",No. 81 Sonoma Collection,89,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,JCB
US,"Tough, acidic and tight in youth, offering little in the way of richness. So tart, so minerally, so dry. A wine that demands time in the cellar. Should reward the patient after six years or so, to allow things to resolve so the cherry, cranberry and rhubarb flavors can transmogrify. It would not be surprising for this wine to develop bottle nuance for well more than a decade.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,94,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Like the winery's 2008 Pinot, this new 2009 is tart. Its acidity cuts right through the rich, ripe cherry and raspberry fruit, giving the wine a sour candy taste. Everything else about it is great.",Durell Vineyard,88,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Three Sticks
US,"Enormously rich and powerful, showing tremendous authority. Oozes ripe, candied raspberry, cherry, sweet cola, licorice, pie spice and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into ripe, fine tannins. Feels really toned, sculpted, with a long, dry, spicy finish. Drink now through 2014.",Split Rock Vineyard,94,43,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saudade
US,"Shows the exotic power of the vineyard, with wild cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, and the crisp acidity of the far Sonoma Coast. But not one you want to drink now. It's tight, dry, minerally, aloof. Needs time. Definitely a wine to cellar until at least 2014.",Peay Vineyard,93,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Nearing four years of age, this Pinot remains tannic and tight. It's dark, full-bodied and rich in cherries and currants, and quite dry. But it flirts with overripeness, which detracts from the wine's delicacy. Ready to drink now.",Clos Camille,88,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Notre Vin
US,"Fans of very fruity wines will enjoy this wine's candy jar of raspberries, cherries, ripe persimmons and pomegranate. It's delicious, although a bit too soft and melted, which makes it taste almost sweet.",Spring Hill Vineyard,87,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman
US,"Defines a coastal style of ripe full bodiedness and bold fruit, although there's a certain generic quality. Offers masses of cherry and blueberry pie, root beer, orange zest, red licorice and pie spices, with a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Yet could offer a little more individuality and identity. Drink now.",,90,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery

US,"Buttered toast, caramel, vanilla bean, spice and pineapple and orange jam aromas and flavors mark this wine. It's a little sweet and white sugary on the finish.",,85,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"Vintages of this wine have been variable, and this 2010 is like the so-so 2009, which earned the same score. It's an okay Pinot Noir, dry and earthy, but rather aggressive in acids and tannins. Ready to drink now.",,84,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
US,"Shows lots of new oak in the buttery toast and sweet vanilla char flavors that ride high over the pineapple jam, soft ripe pear and papayas. A clean, creamy Chardonnay for drinking now.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,88,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Perception
US,"A soft, rather clumsy wine. Despite some rich, ripe cherry jam and spice flavors, it's too sweet and melted.",,84,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Meadowcroft

US,"Fairly pale in color, this Pinot Noir is made in a lighter, drier, more elegant style than many. It's crisp in acids, with the flavors of sweet cherry pie, cola, tangerine peel, cinnamon, anise and sandalwood. Grows increasingly complex as it warms in the glass, changing by the minute. A fascinating wine that should evolve over the next five years.",Stony Point Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,James Family Cellars
US,"An exotic, dry and crisp Chardonnay, with plenty of toasty oak. Shows a mélange of dried orange, pineapple and pear fruit, with a minerally note. There's a feral quality that may be the result of native yeasts. Drink now.",Tweek Block,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Old World
US,"Rather heavy in texture, a big, full-bodied and tannic Pinot that seems overly extracted and oaky. The vintage was very difficult due to early September heat waves, and everything depended on exquisite timing. It's very good, despite the rusticity. Drink now through 2012.",Coastlands Vineyard,87,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Made from eight vineyards located throughout this sprawling appellation, this wine showcases the art of the blend, and is an extraordinary achievement for its sheer opulence. Offers wave after wave of Pinot flavor, with superb tannins and mouthwatering acidity. The fact that this is Merry Edwards's least expensive Pinot Noir is amazing and makes it a special buy. Production was 2,370 cases.",,94,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir from Gundlach Bundschu in many years, maybe ever, but it's also easily their best. It's absolutely delicious in cherries, pomegranates and spices, with a wonderful earthiness that grounds it. So silky and complex, so rewarding to drink now. Great to see this veteran winery coming out with a wine this fine.",Heritage Selection Estate,93,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"The blast of late August and early September heat seems to have victimized this wine. It has a raisiny sharp imbalance, and although it's very dry and silky, does not rise to the level of a great Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir.",Split Rock Vineyard,85,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Cartograph
US,"This vineyard has been source to wildly variable Pinot Noirs, but Garnet, has succeeded in wresting a fine Pinot Noir. It shows the dry silkiness and acidity you want from a coastal Pinot, with elaborate, oak-influenced cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors that finish dry and spicy. Enjoy it over the next five years.",Rodgers Creek Vineyard,91,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Garnet
US,"It's easy to like this smooth, clean sparkling wine, which hails from the Petaluma Gap, an increasingly important area in the cool, foggy south of the Russian River Valley. It's very rich in raspberries and strawberries, with notes of sweet vanilla and yeast. The mouthfeel is smooth and elegant.",Two Pisces Vineyard Reserve Blanc de Noir,91,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,One Hope
US,"Shows the silky dryness and elegance you want in a Pinot Noir, with brisk acidity framing sour cherry, pomegranate and persimmon fruit flavors. Really grows on you as it sits in the glass, warming up and developing complexity. The vineyard has been quite a successful source of grapes to several wineries, including Blessing.",Split Rock Vineyard,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blessing
US,"Ripe fruit and new oak combine for lush, complex flavors in this dramatic young Pinot Noir. It shows real flair in the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, with vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast from aging in French barrels. Easy to like now for its silky texture and long, pure spicy finish.",Estate Vineyard,90,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"Tough to appreciate now due to its acidity and tannins, which lock it down behind a cloak of impenetrability. There are exotic wild raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, licorice, Provençal herb, bacon and pepper flavors, but you can't quite get to them, because they're behind bars. Obviously needs time. Give it 3–5 years in the cellar, and it should begin to blossom after that.",Occidental Vineyard,92,120,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
US,"A barrel selection of lots the winery has to choose from, this is Failla's highest priced Pinot. It's clearly a very fine wine, dry, crisp in coastal acidity and complex. The flavors now range from cherries and currants to cola and tomato juice, wrapped into firm tannins. Not showing delicacy or opulence now, but a Pinot Noir to cellar. Better after 2013.",Vivien,92,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"A little rough in the mouth, with a scoury feeling. But it's extraordinarily rich in orange and lime flavors, with the vanilla and yeasty dough accents you want in a nice sparkling wine.",Split Rock Vineyard Reserve Blanc de Blancs,89,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,One Hope
US,"A strong, powerful Pinot that's nowhere ready to drink. That's despite massive blackberry, cherry, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors that dazzle the palate. The tannins are potent, the acidity is tart and the finish is bone dry. Obviously needs time in the bottle. Try after 2013.",Occidental Ridge Vineyard,92,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"This is a lush, complex Pinot Noir. It shows classic cool-climate acidity and dryness, and long hangtime flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola. But there also are exotic notes of wild berries, spices, cured meats and dried herbs, which make the taste fascinating and elusive. The texture is silky and pure Pinot Noir. Should develop over the next 6–8 years.",Doc's Ranch,92,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
US,"Chard fans who are tired of soft, flabby wines will welcome this dry, crisp bottling. The underlying grape flavors offer lime, Meyer lemon, mango and steely minerals, while winemaker bells and whistles bring needed layers of buttered toast and vanilla cream. A beautiful, classy and elegant Chardonnay; production was only 400 cases.",,92,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"This blend of different vineyards is immediately appealing for its silky mouthfeel and delicious flavors. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon, dusty herb and sandalwood flavors. So pretty, so polished, so refined. Will develop over the next two–four years.",Occidental Coast,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
US,"Give this vigorously young Pinot Noir several hours of decanting, or age it for five–seven years if you can. It's brightly acidic and ripe in cherry, currant and sandalwood flavor, with a gorgeous mouthfeel of velvet and silk. It's a bit ponderous, but there's no denying the power.",Peay Vineyard,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Shows the purity and transparency associated with this fine vineyard, as well as crisp coastal acidity and finely etched tannins. Doesn't possess the depth or concentration of previous vintages, especially 2007, with somewhat curtailed blackberry fruit and a short finish. But then, it was a difficult vintage. Very classy wine to drink now.",Estate Vineyard,90,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Failla
US,"With a nice, silky texture and flavors of cherries, pomegranates and cola, this Pinot has plenty to like. It loses a few points, though, for unripeness that mutes the fruit and makes the finish sharp.",,86,31,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mario Perelli-Minetti
US,"Light bodied and modest in flavor, with lots of acidity. You find yourself wishing there was more in the way of fruit. Still, it's pretty good for the price, with a nice, silky texture.",,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani
US,"There's something off in the aroma, which is herbal and peppery. Turns richer once you take a sip, with pleasantly dry, crisp cherry candy, white pepper and oak flavors. The vineyard is in a cool site, and it tastes like the grapes were not fully ripe. A disappointment after so many great bottlings from MacRostie.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,86,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"Big and ponderous for a Pinot Noir, almost like Grenache, it's so full-bodied and rich in cherries, mocha, anise and spices. Delicious in its way, but lacks Pinot finesse and subtlety. Drink up.",Bella Vigna Vineyard,86,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Whetstone
US,"When a young Pinot Noir is dominated by oak, as this one is, it's a little worrying. Will the oak be absorbed in time, or will it always be excessive? This young wine has pleasant cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors, but the oak seems to have the upper hand. Drink soon.",Estate Grown,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pfendler
US,"Butterscotch and pineapple and peach jam flavors mark this Chardonnay. Fortunately, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a certain minerality. It's an obvious crowd pleaser, and would score higher except for the seemingly sweet finish.",,85,15,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Garnet
US,"Shows brilliantly crisp acidity giving a jammy brightness to the pineapple, lemon and lime fruit flavors, and the finish is totally dry. Not particularly complex, but an easy-drinking Chardonnay.",,87,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Casa de la Cruz
US,"A fairly one-dimensional Pinot Noir. It's soft and drinkable now, with raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Casa de la Cruz
US,"There are some unripe, vegetal flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and simple, although it does boast some cherry and currant flavors, and has a nice, silky texture. Ready now.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Simple Math Cellars
US,"This fruit-forward Pinot offers a blast of cherries and raspberries. It's almost as sweet as jam, but it finishes dry, as the acidity and tannins that constitute its structure rush in. A lovely wine to drink now, right out of the bottle, and over the next few years.",Thornton Vineyard,91,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.",Michaela's Reserve,94,110,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Brogan
US,"This Pinot is immediately drinkable for its early charm, but that doesn't mean it lacks substance. It has complex flavors of red fruits, cola, mushrooms and spices, and is balanced by crisp acidity and a hint of tannins. The texture is pure silk and satin. Quite a serious Pinot Noir, at a great price.",Limited Production,90,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Magistrate
US,"Fresh and crisp in acidity, but very clean and balanced, this young Pinot wants a year or two in the cellar. It's silky, and elegant and rich in raspberries, cherries, cola, pomegranates and sweet, smoky oak.",Split Rock Vineyard,91,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Petito
US,"The grapes come from a vineyard in a part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast appellation that has yet to prove itself. The wine is ripe, with delicious cherry and raspberry-pie-filling flavors liberally accented with the sweet toast and vanilla notes of oak. There's an obvious appeal of deliciousness, and while it doesn't tire the palate, it doesn't offer extreme complexity. Drink now.",,90,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longfellow
US,"Rich in lime, white currant and gooseberry flavors, this wine has lots of acidity that gives it a tingly brightness. It's dry dry and complex, the white wine equivalent of Cabernet Sauvignon.",Hummingbird Hill Vineyards,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dogwood
US,"This is one of the best Pinot Noirs on the market in this price range. It's delicious in raspberry, cola, vanilla, cinnamon spice and smoky oak flavors, wrapped into soft tannins and brightened with acidity. Production was 1,470 cases.",,88,12,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Wonders
US,"Ultrarich in cherry, black raspberry and red currant flavors, with a savory note of grilled beef and the sweet, salty umami of bacon. New oak brings vanilla bean and caramel richness. The result is a strongly flavored wine, but it's balanced with fine acidity. Drink now.",Sangiacomo Old Lakeville Road Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Campesino
US,"Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak. Other than that, it's a bit soft and one-dimensional, but the score reflects how delicious it is.",,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clouds Rest
US,"MacRostie's Pinots from this vineyard on the edge of the Sonoma side of Carneros always are big, ripe, powerful and ageable. This '07 shows the fat, ripe character of the vintage, offering luscious raspberry, cherry, cola, red currant liqueur, bacon, anise, spice and sandalwood flavors. But it's balanced enough to change in interesting ways over the next 5–7 years. Really a glamorous wine for your best meals.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,95,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries. But there are also exotic and delicious notes of bacon, mocha and cola with a blast of black pepper throughout. The wine is full-bodied and dense in tannins, impressive from start to finish. Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,94,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,MacRostie
US,"The best of Belle Glos's 2008 Pinots. It's notable for the extreme richness of the raspberries and cherries, which have a jammy intensity with even more succulent notes of vanilla cream and smoky butter. But the finish is dry, while acidity and tannins bring the wine to earth. Delicious now and through 2014.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,93,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"Showing the art of blending, this small-production Pinot was made from the fruit of six vineyards. It is an exceptional expression of the Sonoma Coast, being translucent in color, dry, silky and crisp in acids. The flavors are complex and delicious, with berries, cherries and persimmons conjoined with mushrooms, spices and new oak. Lovely now, and should develop interestingly over the next 6–8 years.",Akiko's Cuvée,95,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"This is a lovely Chardonnay, a super restaurant wine list bottle. Dry and creamy, it offers pleasantly rich pineapple, lime pie, green apple, exotic spice and buttered toast flavors, accented with crisp, clean acidity.",Russian River Ranches,92,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"An elegant, elaborate Pinot Noir, clearly well grown. The structure is impeccable, with brisk, citrusy acidity and finely ground tannins. The flavors show long hangtime ripeness, flooding the mouth with raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic pie spices. There's even a note of balsam and mushrooms. Very fine now, with decanting, but should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",,92,41,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Tastes thick, heavy and sweet in youth, showing the fantastic ripeness of the vintage, with a flavor of cherry and raspberry marmalade. Oak shows up in the rich addition of buttered cinnamon toast. If that sounds good, it is, and you can enjoy it now. But it will improve with 3–4 years in the bottle.",Wildcat Vineyard,92,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Delicious is the word for this single-vineyard wine, which is a rich blast of raspberry and cherry pie, cola, milk chocolate and sweet, caramelized oak flavors. The alcohol is quite high, but the wine wears it well. Give it a few hours of decanting.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Follette
US,"The majority of the grapes for this lithe, elegant wine come from the Zio Tony Vineyard, with the remainder from Red Car Estate.

US,"Strawberry and a rich streak of raspberry liqueur play nice in this fresh, zesty Pinot. Tight with tension on the palate, it also features layers of earthy forest-floor mushroom. Big in style, it comes together nicely and makes for an enjoyable wine.",,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Terra Valentine
US,"Made in an Alsatian style from a 150-plus-year-old estate vineyard, this dry, well-crafted white is 90% stainless-steel fermented, with the rest fermented in neutral oak.

Flavors of pear and green apple mark the finish.",Estate Vineyard Dry,91,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"The largest production offering of this variety for this producer, this features fruit sourced from a who's who of local growers, including Sangiacomo, Dutton and Martinelli, in addition to the estate-run Wildcat Mountain Vineyard. The result is satisfyingly impressive in viscous oak, graham cracker and Meyer lemon. Tangy and flinty on the finish, it's smooth and focused.",,91,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,MacRostie
US,"Feral and smoky, this light-bodied, light-colored estate-farmed wine gives way to dark cherry, white pepper and pronounced floral elements of rose and violet.

US,"Soft, supple and mouth-coating, this wine dances in cola, forest floor and subtle red and black berry, building power and concentration as it goes. Already given time in bottle, it's ready to enjoy now.",Semper Ellenbach Vineyard,91,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tuck Beckstoffer
US,"From one of the Benziger family's coolest-climate vineyards, and one that is Demeter-certified Biodynamic, there's a richness of cherry amid subtle aromatics of rose and cinnamon spice. A delicate wine that's light in texture, it offers earthiness and a long, balanced finish.",La Reyna,89,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Signaterra Benziger
US,"Made at a somewhat approachable price point, this blend of coastal vineyard sites holds back on fruit and texture. It provides a tightly closed and still youthful touch of savory herb and tea, finishing lean.",,87,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"This wine draws from a handful of tremendous vineyard sites, including the producer's estate, Platt and Clary Ranch, all cool-climate and windswept.

US,"Made by Ross Cobb and Katy Wilson, a rockstar winemaking team, this Pinot is earthy and spicy, a light, softly textured example of the complexity and nuance possible out of the cooler sites of the Sonoma Coast.

US,"Roberts Road is one of the Sangiacomo family's coolest-climate sites, and it offers light, clear color and deliciously floral notes of violet and rose on the nose.

US,This wine offers an aged quality to its accompanying freshness. A taste of honey and dried apple surround soft layers of citrus and a toasted oak finish.,Oro de Plata,90,33,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"Named for a small family property in the south of France, this wine is all about small production and small lots. Fruit is sourced from the grand Klopp Thorn Ridge Ranch. Slightly cloudy, the wine is powerful and concentrated in oak at first, followed by ripe, bright approachable red fruit. Give it through 2020 to get even better.",,90,59,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Pitchoune
US,"This soft, light-bodied wine is on the savory side, a taste of cranberry and rhubarb at its core. It dances in cooler-climate aspects of forest floor and herb, with an unexpected aroma of menthol sneaking into the mix.",Hurst Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Les Voleurs
US,"There's a generosity of tannin and richness to this wine, which offers a depth of high-toned cranberry and strawberry-rhubarb. Still a baby, it needs to open in the glass or decanter to reveal its more shyly etched elements of forest floor and black tea.",,88,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Malk

US,"This is a heady, seriously generous Pinot Noir from a coolish site in the Sonoma Coast AVA that clearly had a banner ripening year in 2012. The fruit is smoky and concentrated in dark berry and cherry, an intriguing bit of spearmint playing around in the background. Rodgers Creek is an estate vineyard for the brand, planted to Pommard clones. A steal at this price.",Rodgers Creek Vineyard,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Garnet

US,"Named for winemaker Ross Cobb's late mother, who more than 20 years ago planted the Coastlands Vineyards' dry-farmed vines—some of the oldest in the region—this exquisitely distinctive wine celebrates all that is extreme and remarkable about the marriage of site, style and variety.

US,"Let the conversations about minerality begin. Whatever it is, or wherever it comes from, it's here big time, adding a lick of steel and a metallic mouthfeel to the underlying fruit. And what powerful fruit it is, ranging from orange and guava to honeydew and citron. This bone dry, crisp Chardonnay is a game changer that will make you look at California Chardonnay differently.",Moon Select,97,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Flowers
US,"Williams Selyem expresses the intricacies of this vineyard with more consistency than any other winery. This remarkably intellectual, ageworthy wine is bone dry, with marked acidity and complexity. The flavors range from wild cherries, cola and balsam to raspberry tart and buttered cinnamon toast. Its complexity is like a mandala, increasing in beauty the longer one examines it. A softly tannic bitterness lingers on the finish; drink 2019–2030.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,97,95,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Wild strawberry and a thicket of dense tannin belie a powerfully strong and elusive wine, still very much tightly wound, indicative of the vintage. A portion (35%) of the grapes were whole-cluster pressed, from tight-spaced, low-yielding vines. A little more oak was used than in most of the producer's other wines, helping to impart a spicy finish.",MK Vineyard,90,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor. A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper.

US,"One sip is all it takes to be blown away by this Pinot's beauty. It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent.

US,"This wine blends multiple clones of Pinot Noir from two of the winery's vineyards, Camp Meeting Ridge and Sea View Ridge. Both sites are high elevation, located only a few miles from the Pacific Ocean and extremely low in yields. Flowers negotiated a difficult vintage deftly with this low-alcohol wine of unusual delicacy and charm. It's complex and layered with cherry, raspberry, cola, wild thyme, balsam and sandalwood flavors. It's texture is like pure silk in the mouth. Drink now–2017.",Moon Select,95,80,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"If you can only cellar one Sonoma Pinot Noir from the 2011 vintage, make it this one. It's a big, tight wine with strong tannins, but somehow never loses sight of Pinot's essential delicacy. Despite the dryness, the wine has a luscious core of raspberries, red currants, cola and rhubarbs, along with subtle oak influences. Do not touch this wine before 2017, although it should still be going strong 15 years from now.",Camp Meeting Ridge Block 16,94,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"Here's one for the cellar. The deliciousness factor is high, but right now, it's all about intense, primary flavors of red plums, rasberries and mulberries framed within bold oak and tannins (in part due to partial whole-cluster fermentation). Still quite immature, it needs at least six more years to meld, but eventually, it's sure to be fantastic.",Camp Meeting Ridge,94,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"This wine is bone dry, yet the fruit is so ripe and rewarding. Flavors of tangerines and apricots are accompanied by a tangy minerality and oak notes attributable to aging in 50% new barrels. So clean and vibrant, it makes for classy drinking now, but it will also be fascinating to watch its evolution over the next 6–8 years.",Camp Meeting Ridge Estate,94,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Flowers

Drink now through 2023.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,93,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lutum
US,"Here's more proof that sometimes a winery's least expensive bottling can be its best. The wine is first class, from the translucent ruby color to the power and delicacy of the mouthfeel. There's something haunting and distinctly Fort Ross-ian in the wild cherry, mushroom and pine flavors that seem to echo the fog, sun and redwood forests of this remote region. Really delicious now and through 2018 or so.",Fort Ross Vineyard Sea Slopes,95,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross

Brooding, this wine offers a dark and dense underbelly of bittersweet chocolate.",Saltonstall Vineyard,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davies
US,"This is a concentrated, lovely wine that offers a depth of red berry, forest floor and herbes de Provence. All of the wine's elements come together seamlessly on the palate. Approachable now, but should also age well.",La Cruz Vineyard,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"The tough, earthy taste of raw mushrooms makes this Pinot less than lush. That's despite some good Lifesaver candy raspberry flavors. The grapes are from the estate vineyard, in the Petaluma Gap. Cold vintage, cool growing area, slightly unripe wine.",El Coro,86,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"A brand-new offering from this producer that usually traffics in Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from its own estate, this initial attempt at a white wine is stunning, a well-honed marriage between site and winemaker. Thick and expansive on the palate, it's a complex study in succulent apple and ginger, with a mineral-laden finish.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Black Kite
US,"Is this Pinot so delicious now you should drink it right away? Or is it deceptively ageable? Both. It's luscious, with ripe raspberry, cola, spice, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that will be gorgeous with steak. But the tannins and acid are so structured, the wine will gracefully age through the next dozen years, increasing in complexity.",Coastlands Vineyard,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"As good as this wine is tasting now, it will be better still with some time. It's bone dry and silky in the mouth with tart streaks of acidity. The palate is complex with flavors of wild red cherry, cola, raspberry, cranberry, balsam, spice and cedar that evolve with every sip as the wine warms in the glass. Give it 5–6 years to meld.",Hirsch Vineyard,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"This shows a dryness and an elegant silkiness that make it lovely to drink now. It's deep and long on the palate, with flavors of raspberry-cherry tart, date, cola and spicy sandalwood. Brisk acidity adds a tart bite that would pair well with steak, lamb, salmon and tuna. It will pick up bottle complexity over the next 10 years.",Three Sisters Vineyard Sea Ridge Meadow,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Martinelli
US,"The winery ventures up north to extreme conditions along the Sonoma Coast and a vineyard named for being as far as “hell and back.” The wine is balanced between oak and fruit, with mellow blue and red berry tones as well as a touch of wild herb.",Ellenbach Vineyard,90,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
US,"From a variety of coastal vineyard locations, this wine, an inaugural offering from the producer, opens in zesty lemon and tangerine, before developing into a fuller-bodied, unctuous experience on the palate. It offers tamped-down acidity and briny back note on the finish.",,87,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,The Forager
US,"With crisp acidity and a delicacy in the mouth, this Pinot has pleasant raspberry, cherry and oak flavors, and is ready to drink now.",Sonoma Signature,85,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Don & Sons
US,"This wine is so compelling it's difficult to put the glass down. It smells buttery and lush and offers flavors of ripe pear, vanilla and a bit of caramel. It is full bodied and plush in texture; that rich viscosity carries the ripe but not over-the-top flavors to a lingering finish.",Durell Vineyard,93,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Saxon Brown
US,"This is dry and tart with acidity, yet rich in fruit. It's a deliciously drinkable wine now, but capable of improving with extended cellaring. With cherry, pomegranate, cola and sweet oak flavors, it finishes with superb balance and charm. Drink now–2020.",Mas Cavalls Doña Margarita Vineyard Unfiltered,93,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"This outstanding Chardonnay shows the brilliant structural purity of both the cold vintage and the terroir of the far Sonoma Coast. While the wine isn't in the same league as Flowers's spectacular Moon Select Chardonnay, it's not as expensive and still deeply satisfying. It's acid-driven with flavors of Meyer lemon, but balanced with notes of tropical fruit, butter and honey.",,92,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Flowers
US,"A delicate, silky mouthfeel makes this wine feel light and vibrant, yet there's nothing light about the flavors. Notes of wild cherries, cranberries, Dr. Pepper, anise, pine and savory spices explode on the palate, and they lead to a long, dry finish. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar.",East Ridge Estate Vineyard,94,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch
US,"Exceptionally fruity in raspberries and cherries, this Pinot shows finely-ground tannins that give it a distinguished texture. It's so forward in flavor that it may not be an ager, so drink up over the next three years.",Gap's Crown,88,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Walt
US,"Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal. High in acidity and tannin, it takes time in the glass to settle down and find its balance, with a lengthy finish of black licorice and clove.",Terra de Promissio,90,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Della
US,"A wonderful spicy, toasted oak character runs through the aroma, flavor and finish of this full-bodied and eminently smooth wine. It smells full of grilled baguette and baking spices like vanilla and nutmeg, tastes almost like cherry pie topped with cream and has a luscious, lingering finish. While technically dry, it seems almost sweet with all those bakery impressions.",Glass House Vineyard,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saxon Brown
US,"Earthy, juicy and leathery, this wine was made from three clones of Pinot Noir. Each was fermented separately with a percentage of whole cluster, then blended together for this age-worthy concoction that's complex and compelling. Pomegranate and fig combine on the palate, along with more savory elements of allspice and coconut, finishing with a crispness of orange. Cellar through 2023.",,92,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Reuling Vineyard

US,"This vintage rivals MacRostie's 2006 and 2007 bottlings. It's already delicious thanks to the raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors that gain complexity from baking spice and sweet, toasty oak notes. The brisk acidity is just about perfect, and the finish is long and rich.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"This is fairly tannic for Pinot  Noir, and it tastes bone dry and tart in acidity. The wild cherry flavor comes with hints of balsam, dusty brown spice, mineral and sandalwood. It shows all of the hallmarks of ageability, so cellar it until 2016, at the very least.",The Bohan-Dillon,93,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch
US,"Complex and nuanced, this Chardonnay is beginning to lose its primary fruit flavors of pears and tropical fruits, and it's becoming dry and mushroomy. The sweet oak tones are also an integral part of the profile. A subtle wine that is compatible with food, it should last for another 3–4 years.",Three Sisters Vineyard Sea Ridge Meadow,93,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Martinelli
US,"One of three new wines for the producer in this vintage, this one is a blend from the Russian River Valley and Carneros estate ranches, Winside and Lawler. Pleasurable from start to finish, it's rich and brooding in black fruit and a touch of graphite, with a balance of lush earthiness.",,90,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stemmler
US,"This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish.",Rice-Spivak Vineyard,92,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Cobb
US,"This is a fine, ageable Pinot Noir that's dry and crisp with acidity. It exhibits a mushroomy earthiness that frames strawberry, cranberry and cola flavors. The window of drinkability begins in 2015.",Camp Meeting Ridge Block 11,92,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers

US,"Classic Fort Ross Pinot Noir, this is rich and textural. The flavors of raspberry parfait and cherry pie are spicy, honeyed and brightened by acidity. Drink now, but it will slowly evolve in the bottle over the next eight years.",Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve,93,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"Dry and tart in acidity, this Pinot Noir offers cherry-skin-like tannins that give the palate a brittle sensation. Give it 5–6 years to let the raspberry and cherry flavors meld with the notes of oak and mineral. It should last the next 15 years, gradually losing its fruit and gaining earthy, mushroomy complexities.",San Andreas Estate Vineyard,93,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch

Medium to light in texture, it finishes smoothly and flat.",,86,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"Dark in color, this is a big, juicy, tantalizing wine from a beautifully farmed vineyard on the edge of the Sonoma Coast, a cool region where grapes ripen slowly.

US,"New French oak, to the tune of 50%, dominates this Chard, giving it buttered toast, vanilla and honey flavors that dominate the underlying pineapples, lemons and limes. The acidity is brisk and vital.",Durell Vineyard,88,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"Very ripe and rich in cherries, cola and sweet red currants, with a jacket of toasty oak. Although this wine is silky in texture, there's a heaviness that makes it Grenache-like. Drink now–2015.",,87,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Canihan
US,"You want to give this wine 5–6 years in the cellar, at the very least, to let its components come together. At the moment, it's quite dry, acidic and oaky. Primary fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries should begin to develop bottle complexity by 2017.",Occidental Ridge,91,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Tart with acidity but lush with fruit, this is a lovely Chardonnay to drink with shellfish dishes. Honeyed notes accompany flavors of tropical fruit, Meyer lemon and lime. Oak lends touches of vanilla and a creaminess that finishes clean.",,91,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla

US,"From the producer's estate ranch, a coveted source of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a 100% stainless-steel wine, low in ripeness, that's enthusiastic in watermelon, cherry and strawberry, smelling like summer.

US,"This Pinot seems to float weightlessly on the palate, yet the flavors sink in instantly and dazzle. Suggestions of raspberries and red cherries come spiced in white pepper and cinnamon, with richer levels of Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and red licorice, all highlighted with the most perfect acidity. It's easy to fall in love with this wine and drink it now, but it can develop interesting complexities through 2020.

US,"A new bottling from the winery. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a cool area south of the Russian River Valley, toward San Francisco. The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling. Drink now–2020.",Terra de Promissio Vineyard,96,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Give this Pinot Noir some time to breathe and mellow in a decanter. Right out of the bottle, it's tough, tannic and jammy in raspberry and cherry flavors. But it doesn't take long for it to pick up some complexities.

Fine tannins and classic coastal acidity provide good balance.",Jenkins Ranch,89,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"This is a dazzling Pinot Noir, so gorgeous to drink for its rich, complex deliciousness. Yet appealing as it is now, there are multiple subtleties waiting to be discovered, and the wine has a fine future. Like all of Marimar's Pinots, it's a big wine—rich and extracted and dense in weight. The flavors veer towards ripe pomegranates, black cherries and sweet licorice, with hints of dark chocolate, orange peel and even the umami of charcuterie. Despite the weight, it magically remains lithe, like a ballerina leaping into the air. Drink now–2019, as it gradually ages.",Mas Cavalls Doña Margarita Vineyard Unfiltered,95,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"A delicately structured, low-alcohol Pinot from the Sonoma Coast that shows winemaker Ehren Jordan's increasing fascination with this part of Sonoma County.

US,"Big and bold, this Chardonnay is made from fruit sourced from the winery's estate vineyard in the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. This underwent barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging, and the result is a rich selection that offers flavors of lemon and tropical fruit, buttered toast and cream. Almost too assertive now, it needs a year or two to resolve.",Estate,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hirsch
US,"Here's a big, ripe and dry Cabernet with flavors of blackberry, molasses and dark chocolate that seem almost overripe due to a touch of raisin.

US,"This wine was made from very specific Pinot Noir clones planted in a small block of the estate vineyard. It's exceptionally ripe with raspberry and cherry flavors, and plenty of new oak.

Drink now–2017.",Chico's Run Doña Margarita Vineyard Unfiltered,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"An awkward Pinot, soft and sweet in raspberry fig Newton cookie and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. The alcohol is pretty high, and shows in the form of heat. Lacks the delicacy you expect from this fine vineyard.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,86,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Trombetta
US,"Lots of zesty, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. The pineapple, crème brûlée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors are so rich that they require balance, which the zippy acidity provides. Maybe a touch too oaky, but that's a matter of personal preference.",No. 81 Sonoma Collection,89,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,JCB
US,"Sweetly overripe with a briny backwash of green olive, this is a plain, weighty white wine that's indistinct.",,82,15,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Goyette
US,"From a vineyard known for producing powerfully ripe, dense fruit with wet-stone minerality, this wine delivers on many of those points. It offers intense, rich tastes of baked apple, graham-cracker crust and crème brûlée. Soft and layered, it ends in a statement of big fruit.",Durell Vineyard,88,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Agnitio
US,"Exotic strips of lemon zest mark this wine, followed by intense acidity that begs for food to tame it down. The vineyards involved are on the cooler side. Expect spice and tangy grapefruit to glide on the finish.",,86,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Schug

US,"Sandalwood and a shovelful of fresh earth mark the entry of this wine aromatically. A soft, tart expression of the variety, it offers bittersweet tannin and dark cherry at its core.",El Coro,87,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,99,94,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Meticulously farmed by Ulises Valdez, Silver Eagle is intensely spicy and pamperingly lush, offering a distinct, perfumed character on the nose.

US,"Soft and ripe enough to drink now, after a decent decanting, it shows pure raspberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, subtlely accented with cola and baking spices, and all of it wrapped into thick but smooth tannins.

Expect dark cherry and blueberry along a foundation of earthy truffle.",,93,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn

US,"A big, thick, ripe Pinot Noir that needs time in the cellar.

US,"The winery's '09 Jenkins Ranch is as good as their spectacular 2007, after a small lapse in 2008. It's made in the Patz & Hall style of succulent, ripe red berry and cherry fruit and sweet oak. The alcohol is quite high, nearly 16%, but the wine doesn't feels hot or unbalanced.",Jenkins Ranch,93,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Fans of very fruity wines will enjoy this wine's candy jar of raspberries, cherries, ripe persimmons and pomegranate. It's delicious, although a bit too soft and melted, which makes it taste almost sweet.",Spring Hill Vineyard,87,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman

US,"This single-vineyard Pinot Noir shows fine coastal acidity and dryness, and a transparency of taste that comes from the terroir. It's very delicious, with jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors enriched with oaky vanillins and smoky, buttery caramel.

US,"High in acidity and low in oak, this is a white that pushes the limits, reflective of the extreme, cool-climate vineyards from which it sources. Fresh-squeezed lemon is the star, the wet-stone minerality razor sharp.",,86,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Red Car
US,"This is an intense, somewhat unformed vineyard-designate, ripe with sweet tannins that takes on considerable barrel flavors of vanilla and caramel.",Thornton Vineyard,85,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Acacia
US,"Hard to keep from falling in love with this wine. It's so luscious in bright, spicy wild cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors. With a satiny texture and brilliant acidity, it's stunningly drinkable now, but should hold and develop over the next six years.",,94,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Lovely and tart, showing the finesse of this cool-climate vineyard. The flavors are of sour red cherries and cranberries. Tastes so sweet and savory, feels so vigorous and filled with life. Yet the mouthfeel is delicate and uplifted. With no new oak, the wine should develop over the next 8–10 years.",Hirsch Vineyard,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lioco
US,"This barrel selection, Keller's best, is an elaborate and complex Pinot Noir. It shows classic coastal acidity, with deep, delicious flavors of raspberries, cherries, mocha, licorice, spices and sweet sandalwood. The tannins are rich enough to let it age over the next six years.",Precioso,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"A very nice Pinot Noir that's likeable for its silky texture, crisp acidity and cherry, raspberry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, with a long, spicy finish. Seems at its best now, so drink up.",,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"Elevates the Keller style of superripe, oaky Chardonnay into a more refined, balanced wine, equally rich but more perfect. It's still potent in buttered toast, vanilla, caramel, honey and pineapple jam, but crisp acidity and minerality help to give structure to the opulence.",Precioso,92,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"There's an inkling of floral character on the nose of this otherwise robust, brooding and brawny vineyard-designate. It's overwhelmed by grippy tannins and a bitterness akin to tobacco. Along the way dark cherry and forest earth make an appearance—particularly pine and a whiff of tar.",Hirsch Vineyard,85,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,FEL

US,"Rhône specialist Donelan ventures into Burgundian territory with this Pinot Noir, with good results. The grapes were grown in the wild Fort Ross area, and the wine shows typical cool-climate acidity and a feral quality to the wild berry, cherry and spice flavors. A fascinating wine that should develop over the next eight years.",Two Brothers,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donelan

Drink now and through 2015.",Sea View Ridge Estate,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"When a young Pinot Noir is dominated by oak, as this one is, it's a little worrying. Will the oak be absorbed in time, or will it always be excessive? This young wine has pleasant cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors, but the oak seems to have the upper hand. Drink soon.",Estate Grown,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pfendler

US,"Shows brilliant acidity, so filled with life and nerve. Very intricate but also quite oaky (60% new), with an eruption of vanilla and sweet char. Underneath is a rich vein of raspberries and strawberries. The oak is just a bit too powerful.",Frances Thompson Estate,91,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"This Pinot is starting to lose its primary fruit, and it's gradually becoming mushroomy and earthy. But the raspberry and cherry flavors are still plentiful, and the finish is dry and clean. It's an interesting, complex wine to drink now.",Andrea La Rue,87,53,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flocchini
US,"A bit heavy and dense in raspberry and cola fruit, with a curiously soft mouthfeel, yet there seems to be good acidity as you swallow. Could just be unresolved now. Give it a year or two to come around.",Sonatera Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Smells and tastes overoaked, with toothpicky vanilla and smoky char notes. The amount of new French wood was 50%.

US,"Almost indistinguishable from a Premier Cru Beaune Burgundy, this Pinot, with alcohol of only 14.1%, is light in body, silky and dry.

A polished, subtle wine that should age well over the next ten years.",Peters Vineyard Winemakers Reserve,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir. It's so light bodied, so silky in the mouth, that the richness comes as a surprise.

US,"This wine comes from a vineyard planted in the early 2000s in the Sebastopol Hills by Charlie Chenoweth for the Jenkins family, a country music trio consisting of Nancy Jenkins and her two daughters. It is inviting and seductive in black cherry and baking spices. Tightly wound, it has nuance and a lingering afterthought of savory pepper and meat.",Jenkins Ranch,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Dramatically ripe, offering tiers of cherries, black raspberries, blackberries and cola, with the toast and vanilla spice of oak barrels. Very extracted in fruit now, sweet and jammy, almost rustic, with crisp acidity. The question is whether it will age. The vineyard is exceptional, home to great bottlings from Fulcrum, Sojourn, Patz & Hall, MacPhail and Roessler, among others.

The tannins are just about perfect. Delicious, but would benefit from greater subtlety and complexity beyond mere fruit.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"Such are the tannins on this bone-dry Pinot Noir that it feels astringent and rustic now. That's despite a deep, sweetly ripe core of blackberries and currants. It's certainly a big wine, packing in enough power for two wines, but lacking somewhat in delicacy and finesse. Give this brooding wine a good, long decant. Could come around after eight years or so in the bottle.",Coastlands Vineyard,89,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Siduri should have held this bottle back for a year or two, because it's tight, tannic and tough now. But they didn't, so you'll have to cellar it for a while.

US,"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, lending buttered toast, vanilla and caramel aromas and flavors, while the underlying fruit veers toward very ripe, sweet pineapples. Made in the modern style, it will appeal to Chardonnay lovers of flash, but ultimately palls for too much upfront sweetness.",La Cruz Vineyard,88,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"A difficult wine to assess. It's so ripe and forward in sweet cherry jam and smoky, caramelized oak that it seems like a mere fruit bomb at first sip.

This is fresh and focused.",,92,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall

US,"A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak.

US,"Stemmy in earthy pine and clove-like spice, this is a powerfully dense and delicious wine. It's on the higher side in terms of alcohol, though doesn't reflect it in bouquet or taste.

US,"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,95,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
US,"A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It displays the qualities of dryness and yeastiness, with complex flavors of limes, vanilla and a touch of raspberry.

US,"Tastes fresh and jammy now in raspberry and cherry flavors, with a cut of lime acidity. One third new oak adds a delicious coating of sweet vanilla and toast. Very delicious and distinctive, but immature. Cellar it for 2–3 years to let it mellow and knit together.",Split Rock Vineyard,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blessing
US,"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",Hirsch Vineyard,99,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"In recent years, Precious Mountain Vineyard has provided Bob Cabral with some of his most glorious fruit. Tremendous in flash and depth, it offers compelling flavors of raspberry and cherry, accented by sweet, smoky oak.

US,"This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress.",Clos Madeleine,93,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Notre Vin
US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",Estate Grown,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pfendler

There's a spicy, silky elegance that makes repeated sips rewarding. Now through 2014.",La Brisa,92,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Brisk acidity brightens the ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, giving it a clean, lively mouthfeel. There's a jacket of tannins, but it's fine and easy, and oak brings just the right touch of sweet toast flavor. Lovely to drink now, and it should develop bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.",Coastlands Vineyard,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This wine drinks qualitatively above and behind its low price, delivering light, clear color and tangy wisps of cranberry and citrus-tinged minerality. With a depth of character that builds on the midpalate, it finishes lean and crisp, a wonderfully elegant expression of the variety.",,91,14,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Broken Clouds
US,"A reductive element of petrol and oak blows off over time bouquet-wise, but in taste and weight, the wine retains a sultry sense of oak and baked apple. Full bodied in style, it manages to stay balanced throughout, finishing in a buoyant twist of citrus.",,91,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Glasshaus
US,"Sweet, rich and oaky, marked by flavors of buttered popcorn, toast, pineapple jam and ripe apricots. Made in the modern style that will be liked by many, but not particularly sophisticated.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,James Family Cellars
US,"This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast.",,92,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"Fistfuls of rustic, pungent earth rise out of this silky, complex wine that is sourced from Nobles and Spring Hill vineyards. A sauvage element keeps it dancing on the edge in terms of balance between savory black tea and forest, and crisp, red berry. Smooth and soft, it meets a demure end.",,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davies
US,"Fresh and crisp in acidity, but very clean and balanced, this young Pinot wants a year or two in the cellar. It's silky, and elegant and rich in raspberries, cherries, cola, pomegranates and sweet, smoky oak.",Split Rock Vineyard,91,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Petito
US,"The grapes come from a vineyard in a part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast appellation that has yet to prove itself. The wine is ripe, with delicious cherry and raspberry-pie-filling flavors liberally accented with the sweet toast and vanilla notes of oak. There's an obvious appeal of deliciousness, and while it doesn't tire the palate, it doesn't offer extreme complexity. Drink now.",,90,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longfellow
US,"Seems rushed to market too quickly at barely more than a year of age. There may be something good inside yearning to come out, but now, it's all impatient berry jam, fresh acidity and oak, almost like a barrel sample. Should develop into a more nuanced Pinot by 2012.",McDougall Ranch Vineyard,88,47,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Drew
US,"A very fine Pinot Noir that shows deep, impressively ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, red currant, licorice and Asian spices, with a rich coating of smoky oak. It's entirely dry, and has a brisk scour of acidity. Seems best now and for the next few years.",,91,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"Gentle and silky, this Pinot Noir has perfumes of rose petals, ripe red cherries, flat cola and sandalwood, plus a hint of grilled bacon. It tastes as sweetly delicious as it smells, and it feels round, supple and polished. So easy to drink now, but you might miss the complexity if you do.",MK Vineyard,92,71,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"Muddled at first, this wine comes around to reveal a strong, floral component of rose water and geranium, staying light and fresh on the palate, subtle yet flavorful. It finishes earthy in Asian spice.",,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Glasshaus
US,"This is a softly appealing yet ultimately simple wine. It's flamboyant in flavor, suggested buttered white toast, spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with cinnamon. Ready now.",Corona Creek Vineyard,85,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stomping Girl
US,"Tastes jammy all the way through, with raspberry and cherry flavors that start and end sweet and sugary. The problem isn't the ripeness, it's the balance and control throughout the palate experience. This Pinot Noir should finish dry but doesn't, which makes it disappointing, especially at this price.",Winemaker's Reserve Peters Vineyard,86,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"Simple and sweet, with sugared tangerine and vanilla flavors, enriched with caramelized oak. The blend is mostly Viognier, with Roussanne and Marsanne.",La Naris,85,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,White Blend,Sheldon
US,"Fresh, fruity and candied, with raspberry, cherry and cola flavors brightened by crisp, cool-climate acidity. This Pinot is meant to be opened now and over the next few years.",,88,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"This is a nice Chardonnay to drink with shellfish, particularly grilled shrimp. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with rich pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, accented with sweet, toasty oak.",,88,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"This has been a consistent bottling for Landmark over the years. They took a price increase this vintage, but it's a very fine Pinot Noir. Crisp and elegant, it brims with flavors of wild mountain cherries, raspberries, cola, orange zest, smoky oak and forest notes of pine and chamomile.",Grand Detour,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"This is a very pure Pinot Noir. It shows its origins in the silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity, as well as a certain minerality that grounds the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's quite good, but not an ager, so drink soon.",,88,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Made in a big, rich, heavy style, almost Rhône-like, and not showing the delicacy and elegance you want in a nice Pinot Noir. The flavors are of cherries, mulberries and cola. Will lighten up and sweeten as the years go by.",,86,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Olson Ogden
US,"This is a candied, slightly sweet Pinot Noir, pretty rustic all around. Its acidity and sugary finish give it a raspberry and cherry, sweet and sour taste.",Director's,84,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Francis Coppola
US,"The name suggests the Aussie Shiraz style of this richly fruity Syrah. It offers a mouthburst of juicy raspberries, blackberries, cherries, cocoa, bacon, licorice and sandalwood, wrapped into firm tannins. Drink now, with rich fare, like BBQ or a holiday smoked ham.",Grower's Reserve Shazzam!,86,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Clary Ranch
US,"Lots to like in this silky wine. It has a very pure, light feeling in the mouth, with pleasant cherry, cranberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. But it tastes too tutti-fruity sweet throughout, and turns candied on the finish.",Gopher Hill Block Peter's Vineyard,87,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"Tannic, dry and acidic now, this doesn't offer much of the immediate opulence found in many California Pinot Noirs. The richness is in there, but it's buried. The sweet core of cherries, currants, exotic spices, mushrooms and minerals is just waiting for time to release it. Cellar this for 6–8 years.",,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kalaris
US,"Ultrarich in cherry, black raspberry and red currant flavors, with a savory note of grilled beef and the sweet, salty umami of bacon. New oak brings vanilla bean and caramel richness. The result is a strongly flavored wine, but it's balanced with fine acidity. Drink now.",Sangiacomo Old Lakeville Road Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Campesino
US,"Acidic and gritty. Despite some good raspberry-cherry flavors and sweet oak, this Pinot is hard to like, lacking richness and opulence. Drink now.",Grand Detour,84,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"There is lots to like in this Chablis-like Chardonnay. It's dry, bright in acidity and minerally, with an undercurrent of citrus, Asian pear and tropical fruit flavors. Oak plays a subtle but essential part in the wine's richness.",Charm Acres,90,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"Very rich and extracted, this shows the power of fine coastal Pinot Noir. It's also very tannic and in need of some time in the cellar. It has a deep core of red cherries, pomegranates, red currants and licorice, but the ripeness is wrapped in a shroud of astringency. Give it 5–6 years to begin to emerge from this cocoon.",,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kalaris
US,"Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak. Other than that, it's a bit soft and one-dimensional, but the score reflects how delicious it is.",,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clouds Rest
US,"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins. Drink now, for fresh, jammy fruitiness.",Griffin's Lair,89,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015.",San Andreas,95,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch
US,"From the estate vineyard, west of Sebastopol. Made in a lighter-colored, ligher-bodied style than most Russian River Pinot Noirs, the wine shows flashy toast, raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and clove aromas and flavors. A complex, elegant young wine that should develop over the next six years.",The Pivot Vineyard,94,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Littorai
US,"Low in alcohol, high in acidity and ultra-dry, this Syrah is pretty severe in the mouth. It has a tight, citrusy tartness, with sour cherry candy and orange rind flavors. Give it a good, long decant.",Syrah du Soleil Coryelle Fields Vineyard Sue's Block,86,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Collier Falls
US,"The vineyard lies between Freestone and Bodega Bay, one of the coolest parts of the far Sonoma Coast. The wine is fairly pale for a California Pinot Noir, with nuanced flavors of toast, spices, raspberries and persimmons, in a silky, vibrant texture. The oak application has not yet been fully integrated. Give it 2–4 years in the bottle.",Platt Vineyard,93,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Littorai
US,"A gorgeous evocation of Pinot Noir. Pours pale in color and translucent, suggesting it's not a heavy fruit bomb, and indeed it is not. Feels as light as a cloud, yet with intense flavors of red stone fruits, bacon and spices, and that feral, wild forest quality you get from the best Sonoma Coast Pinot Noirs. Bone dry, but so sweet in fruit and cedar, with wonderful acidity. Superb now, after decanting, and should develop over the next 6–8 years.",Bill and Joan's Special Selection Maritime,95,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"James Family continues to produce solid Pinot Noirs from this vineyard that are typical of the Sonoma Coast. The wine is dry, properly tart in acidity, and has flavors of pomegranates and cranberries, with astringent cherry-skin-like tannins.",Stony Point Vineyard Estate,89,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,James Family Cellars
US,"There's a harshness in the mouth to this otherwise likable Pinot Noir. It has the dry astringency of shriveled berry skins, which mar the cherry and cola flavors. Ready now.",,83,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fortunati
US,"Not as pricey as the winery's San Andreas bottling, but in the same style. Light-bodied, elegant, dry and modest in alcohol, yet with great focus and intensity. A lovely wine that's a relative bargain.",The Bohan-Dillon,92,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch
US,"Bring on the tuna, either tartare or lightly grilled. This is the perfect wine. It's bone dry, light and silky in the mouth, and crisp in acidity, a lovely, elegant Pinot Noir with modest alcohol that feels just fine. The flavors are of cherries, cola and pomegranates. Beautiful now, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",Maritime,93,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"A lovely bottle of Pinot Noir, dry and silky and considerably lighter in body than most. Despite the lightness of texture, the wine is powerful, with succulent raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, anise and white pepper flavors that linger long in the finish. Should develop in the bottle for at least six years.",Marimar Estate Vineyard,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"Distinctly Sonoma Coast in the forest berry fruits and feral, earthy notes of anise, balsam and Dr. Pepper cola. Fine and silky in the mouth, with modest alcohol and a burst of cool-climate acidity. A more feminine style of Pinot, which is not to understate its power. Could easily develop over the next six years, but it's pretty compelling now.",,93,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"It will be fascinating to taste this wine in six, eight, ten years. Right now, it's big, thick, dry and powerful. So sweet is the cherry fruit and so silky is the texture that the wine could almost be a young Grenache. Seems to have what it takes to age, so try after 2015.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,80,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"A young, vigorous Pinot that should reward some time in the cellar. Right now, it's strong in acidity and fairly tannic despite the light texture. The flavors are interesting and complex, with not just ripe red cherries as well as all kinds of wild notes of herb tea, anise, grilled mushrooms, pine needles and persimmons. Drink this fascinating wine as it slowly changes over the next eight years.",Hellenthal Vineyard,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"Shows some notes of mold or vegetables, marring an otherwise fine wine. It's pale in color, dry and crisp in acidity, with a beautifully silky texture and flavors of cola and cherries.",Umino Vineyard,83,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"Enormously ripe in cherries, raspberries, cranberries and dates, almost sweet, except that it's totally dry, and the acidity is fresh and bright. A big, big wine that dazzles for sheer power, although it's not especially subtle right now. That could change in the cellar. Give it a few years, and then a good decanting before service.",,92,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"Lots of toasty new oak on this Pinot, which gives it a sweet roasted marshmallow aroma and taste. Mixed in are rich flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola, sprinkled with cinnamon and pepper. An exotic, powerful wine. Too bold and in your face now, but should gain traction over the next eight years.",Liberty Bridge Split Rock Vineyard,92,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
US,"The challenge with a Chardonnay this big is to wrestle the power into submissive balance. As it is, the wine is overwhelming in buttery new oak and awesomely ripe pineapple and apricot fruit. It's almost undrinkable now. However, there's a brisk streak of acidity, and It's totally dry, with a stony minerality, like a lick of steel. Try cellaring for 3–4 years.",Pastorale Vineyard,92,80,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"Lots of acidity in this young wine, maybe more than some wine lovers will be comfortable with. That gives the enormously ripe cherry and persimmon fruit a bite, and could help this dry, silky wine to develop in the cellar. It's of a piece with the 2007 and 2008. Try after 2015.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,92,80,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"A huge Pinot Noir, superripe and exotic in raspberry and cherry jam, persimmon, cola, cinnamon, clove and sandalwood flavors. Defines the Sonoma Coast, with a crisp spine of acidity providing bright structure. Bold now, all fruit and oak, but has the balance to develop bottle nuance through 2015, at the very least.",Poinsett Split Rock Vineyard,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
US,"Very Chablis-like, this coastal Chardonnay has high acidity that makes it clean and vibrant. The flavors are marked by minerals and Meyer lemons, with a touch of smoky oak. It's a fine, dry white wine that will pair well with a wide range of foods, and it's from Francis Ford Coppola.",Votre Santé,87,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"A terrific Pinot, and one of the few that absolutely demands cellaring. The tannic structure is enormous, providing a sandpapery dryness to the palate. Yet the flavor explosion is so powerful, you can enjoy it now with utter satisfaction. Erupts in grilled blackberry and cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon, anise, sautéed wild mushroom and smoky sandalwood flavors, leading to a spicy finish that continues for a full minute. Glorious and decadent. The winemaker was Sashi Moorman, from Stolpman, and the vineyard was planted in 1994 to the Calera clone. Only 115 cases were produced. Drink now–2017.",Occidental Vineyard,98,150,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
US,"Gorgeous and immaculate. Showcases Russian River/Sonoma Coast Pinot at its finest, with superb acidity, ultra-refined tannins and flavors of grilled blackberries, cherry pie filling, cola, crushed black pepper, cinnamon, anise and smoky, caramelized sandalwood. As rich as it is, there's an elusive quality, with hints of wild game and undefineable forest floor. Beautiful now and through 2015.",Occidental Coast Two Daughters Vineyard,96,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
US,"Could be a Sauvignon Blanc, with Meyer lemon, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, accented with crisp acidity. That's no disrespect. It's a compliment, in this age of clumsy, overoaked Chardonnays. Elegant and food-friendly, it's brightened with the acidity of a fresh lime.",,91,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Roth
US,"Shows the coolness of the vintage with a tartly acidic mouthfeel that gives the cherry and raspberry flavors a sour candy feel. Other flavors include mint and a pleasantly sweet touch of butterscotch from oak. Other than the sharpness, this is a pretty nice Pinot.",Gap's Crown,87,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Rich and ripe, this wine has orange, mango, apricot and vanilla flavors, accented by bright acidity. It offers immediate appeal to fans of the oak-driven Chardonnay style.",No. 81,88,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,JCB
US,"Go elsewhere if you're looking for a big, oaky Chardonnay fruit bomb. This one is controlled and elegant, offering tantalizing hints of pineapples, minerals, sweet cream, buttered toast and spices. The acidity is mouthwatering. An elegant, food-friendly wine at a good price.",No. 81 Sonoma Collection,91,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,JCB
US,"Shows plenty of finesse in the dry, minerally profile, and the crisp acidity that makes the finish clean and savory. Could be a bit richer, but the pineapple and lemon candy flavors satisfy.",Golden Coast,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"There's a sugary sweetness to this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, in roughly equal measures. It's rich and ripe in raspberries, limes and oranges, with the doughy, leesy sourness that marks a good sparkling wine. Feels somewhat rough and aggressive now, but elegant and complex. Could develop bottle complexity over this decade.",Brut,90,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
US,"Sebastiani has had good results with their Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, and this bottling continues that tradition. It's a lovely wine, dry and rich, with raspberry and cherry pie, sweet, smoky oak and spice flavors, brightened with fine acidity. A wonderful wine for restaurants at a price that's affordable.",,90,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani
US,"This is a tough, gritty young Pinot Noir now in its infancy. It's made of acids and feral, forest berries, pine needles and spicy anise, a menagerie of mouth impressions without a clear focus. Yet it could meld together with some years in the cellar. Try after 2010.",No. 7 Sonoma Collection,89,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,JCB
US,"Shows all the hallmarks of a fine Sonoma Coast Pinot. It's dry, crisp in acidity, elegant in structure and complex, with an array of red berry, red currant, pine, cola, clove and sandalwood flavors. Drink now, after a brief decant.",,90,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kutch
US,"Very rich in wild cherry, raspberry, red currant, tangerine zest, cola and smoky oak flavors, this Pinot also has a closed, quality due to vibrant acidity and some very finely ground tannins. Decant if you drink now. Could come into its own after 2010, but it's an unproved wine from the Boisset America team.",No. 11,88,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,JCB
US,"Lots of acidity in this fresh young Pinot. Oak, too, which gives dominating aromas and flavors of toast and caramel. Underneath is a rich wine, filled with raspberry, cola, sautéed mushroom and spice flavors. Should develop over the next 2–3 years.",Le Roi,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach

US,"Presents with equal parts crisp acidity, buttered toast new oak and ripe pineapple and kumquat fruit. The result is big and flashy, but a little Frankensteinian.",Estate Grown,89,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"A little one-dimensional, but elegantly structured, with crisp coastal acidity and finely meshed tannins. The flavors of this regional-style Pinot Noir veer toward early drinking cherries, rhubarbs, pomegranates and cola.",Votre Santé,86,27,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Nothing charming about this wine, which is sweet, acidic and fruity, like a Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy. Pretty expensive for what you get.",Charm Acres,83,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"Quite tart as you'd expect from a coastal vineyard in this region, with acid-inspired long hangtime flavors of cherries and raspberries, accented with smoky oak. Tastes a tad sweet and fruit-bomby at the age of three years.",Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block,87,79,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Dry and acidic, with interesting flavors of spices, wild forest red berries, cola and bacon. An exotic, low alcohol Pinot Noir that seems at its best now and for a couple years.",Falstaff,89,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kutch

US,"Inky dark and full-bodied, this Syrah has all the hallmarks of a young wine. It's dry and extremely rich in blackberry, wild cherry and blueberry flavors, accented with smoky oak, violets and pepper. Really nice, but maybe too soft for aging.",,87,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Wine Spots
US,"A bit tough and gritty, with a less-than-ripe green tomato flavor alongside the notes of cherry and pomegranate. Oaky richness adds sweetness and texture to this wine. It's not going anywhere, but the acid-tannin structure and minerality are pleasurable. Give it a decant and enjoy.",Stony Point Vineyard Estate,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,James Family Cellars
US,"A dazzlingly good Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the precision of flavor and structure. Shows the massively ripe character of the vintage, with a starburst of raspberries, cherries, cola, minerals and spices, while the acidity and tannins are just about perfect. This crowd pleaser is just extraordinary now, and should develop in the bottle over the next six years.",Precioso,95,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.",Precioso,95,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak. Packed with raspberries and cherries, the wine is completely dry and firm in minerals, and seems easily able to age for at least six years. Only 120 cases were produced.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,94,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"Very delicious in terms of sheer flavor. Floods the mouth with ripe, rich black cherries, black raspberries, milk chocolate, licorice and spicy, oaky vanilla. Could have more structure, though. Drink now.",Peters Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"Anyone who doesn't love this Pinot just doesn't understand California's approach. It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity. Just beautiful, and it grows better as it warms in the glass. Probably not an ager, but wonderful now and through 2013.",Burnside Vineyard,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Another terrific wine from this vineyard, following the superb '07. May be a bit less flamboyant, but with better structure, and equally ageable. Dry and full bodied and fairly tannic, it shows powerful cherry and raspberry fruit, smoked meat, sautéed wild mushroom and sandalwood flavors, liberally spiced. Drinkable now, and should develop through 2014, at least.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"Sought-after vineyard grower Charles Heintz has teamed with stellar Sonoma County winemaker Hugh Chappelle (Lynmar, Quivira) to make this divine estate-grown Rosé, pale pink in the glass with hugely inviting floral aromatics.

US,"Roessler produces lots of single-vineyard wines, but this has not been one of their best ones. It's a good wine, not without interest, with plenty of compact cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors. But it's very acidic. Decant it for hours.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,88,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"This young, impetuous Pinot Noir needs time in the cellar to calm down. It's all about fresh acidity of the citrus kind and ripe, jammy cherry and raspberry fruit, not to mention sweet, unintegrated oak. Give it a good four years.",,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kanzler
US,"Marked by softness and firm tannins, this Pinotage has the weight of a Cabernet Sauvignon. The flavors are of cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa, violets and smoky oak. The finish is a little candied. Drink now.",Fort Ross Vineyard,86,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinotage,Fort Ross
US,"MacRostie's Pinots from this vineyard on the edge of the Sonoma side of Carneros always are big, ripe, powerful and ageable. This '07 shows the fat, ripe character of the vintage, offering luscious raspberry, cherry, cola, red currant liqueur, bacon, anise, spice and sandalwood flavors. But it's balanced enough to change in interesting ways over the next 5–7 years. Really a glamorous wine for your best meals.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,95,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"An appealing Pinot for its fresh, silky mouthfeel and delicious flavors. Rich in raspberry-cherry pie filling and cola, with a funky edge of bacon, it's finished with smoky oak. A rather sweet wine to drink now.",No 7. Sonoma Collection,88,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,JCB
US,"Many wineries have dipped into this Petaluma Gap-grown vineyard for grapes, and now MacPhail does. The wine shows the cool-climate crispness of the region, with zesty acidity. It's bone dry and minerally, a Chablis-style Chardonnay with tangerine fruit and some new oak sweetness.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,MacPhail
US,"Made in a light-bodied, lower-alcohol style, this Pinot feels silky and gentle in the mouth. It really delivers when it comes to flavor. Displays big, impressive notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood that are complex and satisfying, and that finish entirely dry. Drink now and over the next four years.",La Cruz Vineyard,92,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"With pineapple, green apple and lime flavors brightened by crisp acidity, this Chardonnay is totally dry, although it picks up some sweetness from oak barrels. It's not very complex. But it is clean and elegant.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,87,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peters Family
US,"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries. But there are also exotic and delicious notes of bacon, mocha and cola with a blast of black pepper throughout. The wine is full-bodied and dense in tannins, impressive from start to finish. Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,94,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,MacRostie
US,"A brilliant Pinot Noir, grown organically from the winery's new vineyard in a cool part of the coastal mountains. More tannic and acidic than Pinots from the estate vineyard in Green Valley, it offers lush, deep flavors of cherries, black raspberries, gingersnap cookies and almond biscotti. Just terrific, and will take a few years of bottle age in a cool cellar.",Mas Cavalls Doña Margarita Vineyard,94,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"Rich and appealing in raspberry, cola, cocoa and sweet oak notes, this Pinot is almost sweet. But it finishes dry, in a swirl of dusty spices. Drink now.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"What's so nice about this Chardonnay is the way the dryness, acidity and minerality combine with tropical fruit to make for a splendid, Chablis-style California wine. It's a connoisseur's Chardonnay, requiring some understanding of structure. Don't drink it too cold; could even stand a brief decant at room temperature.",,91,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,91,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Expression 38
US,"This classy young Pinot is the second release from the winery's only Petaluma Gap vineyard. It's bone dry, mouthwateringly tart in acidity and delicate in structure, with complex cherry, cranberry, persimmon and cola flavors, nicely augmented by smoky oak. You can drink it now, after decanting for an hour or two, and it will soften a bit, or hold until 2020.",Terra de Promissio Vineyard,92,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.",McDougall Vineyard,93,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"A good rosé, one of the better ones. Dry and crisply acidic, with a nice minerally tang to the raspberries and toast, and a clean, spicy finish. Ham, in whatever form, is a natural partner.",Rosé of,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"This is a dry, elegant young Pinot Noir. It's rich in acidity, and the cherry and cola flavors are sprinkled with zesty white pepper. Seems to be giving its best now.",,87,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"The best of Belle Glos's 2008 Pinots. It's notable for the extreme richness of the raspberries and cherries, which have a jammy intensity with even more succulent notes of vanilla cream and smoky butter. But the finish is dry, while acidity and tannins bring the wine to earth. Delicious now and through 2014.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,93,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",,90,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Expression 38
US,"With a little oak to provide a touch of vanilla cream, this is a pleasant Sauvignon for drinking with a wide variety of foods. It's dryish to just slightly off dry, with rich pineapple, orange, lime and pink grapefruit flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Bump Wine Cellars
US,"This shows the lovely balance of both the winery and the appellation, with a silky, lightly tannic mouthfeel brightened by plenty of acidity. The flavors are delicate and complex, suggesting wild raspberries, thyme, cranberries and toast. No reason to age this puppy, so drink now–2016.",,91,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs

US,"Soft and appealing, this Pinot offers lush, elaborate flavors of raspberry and cherry pie filling, mocha and sandalwood flavors, finished with sweet, dusty Indian spices. It's made for drinking now.",Thornton Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Sweet and extracted in pineapple, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors, this Chardonnay also is generously oaked, which gives it even richer vanilla and buttered toast notes. It's flashy, yet would benefit from greater dryness and restraint. Size isn't everything.",,86,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Anaba
US,"Marked by big, sharp acidity, like biting into a lime, and clean, linear flavors of limes, green apples and pineapples, this bone-dry Chardonnay badly needs food to balance it out. Think of bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, or a spicy Ahi tuna tartare dish.",,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Tastes raisiny, overripe and sweet in cherry jam flavor, with a harsh, peppery mouthfeel. Basically drinkable, but not going anywhere.",,82,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Verve

US,"This is a dark, glyceriney, full-bodied Syrah that should have been held back a little longer before release, but you can make up for that with cellaring. It's tannic and raw now, but packed with blackberry, currant, licorice and pepper flavors that are totally dry, and firmed up with crisp acids. Best for a few years after 2009.",Stage Gulch Vineyard,91,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"A nice Pinot Noir, dry and elegant, and if it's somewhat one-dimensional, it packs a lot of flavor. With rich raspberry, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, it's a lovely wine to drink now.",,87,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,William Knuttel
US,"This is a lovely Chardonnay, a super restaurant wine list bottle. Dry and creamy, it offers pleasantly rich pineapple, lime pie, green apple, exotic spice and buttered toast flavors, accented with crisp, clean acidity.",Russian River Ranches,92,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"This is one tight young Pinot Noir. You take the first sip, and the acidity hits you, then the tannins, and finally the fruit, which is ripe and vast in raspberries and strawberries. Oak adds smoky caramel to this parfait. Give it until 2018 or 2019, when it should hit its peak.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bruliam
US,"Rich doesn't begin to describe this Chard. It's humongous in pie-filling and grilled peaches, pears, pineapples and papayas, while 50% new oak adds all sorts of buttercream, crème brûlée and smoked butter layers. Yet the wine shows a minerality that grounds and balances it. Very fancy stuff, and should age for up to six years.",,93,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"This is a big, gutsy Pinot Noir, the kind purists object to as being Rhône-like. But that's what MacRostie's vineyard gives them, and the wine is brilliant in its power and California deliciousness. With thick tannins but a silky texture, it offers waves of raspberries, cherries, currants, pomegranates, baker's chocolate and cola. Should develop well over the next six years.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"An intriguing Pinot Noir that shows the possibilities of this cool-climate, southwestern Sonoma region. The wine has been well-oaked, but it's powerful enough to carry that coating of caramel and char, with a massive palate explosion of puréed ripe cherries, red currants and sweet rhubarb pie. Delicious now with decanting, and should do interesting things over the next six years.",Freestone Hills,92,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"A soft, somewhat one-dimensional wine that doesn't possess the brightness or interest you expect in a Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir. That's despite some very rich cherry, licorice, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink up.",King Ridge Vineyard,86,59,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Nero,Castello di Amorosa
US,"A pretty good Pinot Noir, although It's a little expensive for what you get. Nicely dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry and persimmon flavors, but needs greater depth and complexity.",,86,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bartz-Allen
US,"Light in body and tart in acids, this bone-dry Pinot Noir shows modest flavors of cherry skins, red apple peelings and cola.",Lot 326,84,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Cameron Hughes
US,"A challenging wine. It's rather strong and dry and extracted now, lacking delicacy, and makes you want to stick it in the cellar for a while. Yet there's a certain hollowness that may limit ageability. If you drink it now, give it a good decant.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Tough and gritty in youth, this Pinot is showing edgy tannins, tart acidity and unincorporated oak. It's almost like a barrel sample. But it's stuffed with currant, licorice and mocha flavors, and should develop well in the bottle. Try after 2009.",Ridges Ollie & Hazel's Block,90,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"This is a blend of blocks from the large estate vineyard, yielding a very complete wine. It's brisk in acidity, dry and silky, with low alcohol and firm tannins framing raspberry and cherry skin, cola and pomegranate flavors.",San Andreas Fault,90,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch
US,"Elegant and rich, but too acidic, almost unnaturally, giving the wine a sour cherry and raspberry Lifesaver candy tartness. This sharpness will probably never disappear.",McDougall Vineyard,86,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kutch
US,"One of the richer Pinots out there, just packed with ripe raspberries and cherries, like the filling in a pie. Shows great, cool-climate acidity, and the texture is as light and silky as can be. Defines the best of a drink-now style.",,89,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"A flamboyant, sweetly fruity wine, brimming with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally oaked. Made in an approachable style for drinking now.",,86,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Box Car
US,"Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.",Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block,91,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Shows its cool-climate origins with a certain austerity that accompanies the exotic wild cherry, currant, Mandarin orange and root beer flavors, accented with sweet smoky oak. A rush of acids and tannins takes over the palate, strongly suggesting modest ageability. Give this Pinot Noir a year or two in the cellar.",Split Rock Vineyard,90,43,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saudade
US,"A very interesting and complex Sauvignon Blanc that shows a Sancerre-like flinty minerality, along with a broad array of figs, melons, citrus and tropical fruits. There's a smoky, honeyed edge that makes for true richness.",Laguna Vista Vineyards Sur Lies Selection,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Acidity, dryness and steely minerality characterize this Chard. It has lemon and vanilla flavors that are brisk and clean. It's refreshing to get such an elegant alternative to today's ripe, fruity Chards. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink this brilliant wine with shellfish, sourdough bread and lots of butter.",,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ovation
US,"Made with Dijon clones from a vineyard in a cool corner of Sebastopol, this rich young Pinot brims with fresh acidity. It has complex flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, rhubarb, sandalwood and pepper, wrapped into a silky texture. Just a delight, and should age over the next six years.",Goodin Vineyard,94,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Very dry and pretty tannic, this cool-climate Syrah combines its blackberry and cherry fruit with less ripe notes of herbs and even a touch of asparagus. Intense umami flavors of salty, smoky bacon give it richness. Drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,88,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"Made in a lighter, silkier, more accessible style, this is an elegant Pinot Noir that suggests lamb, roast salmon and other upscale dishes. It's easy to drink, but also complex, with intricately layered flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants, licorice, sassafras, sweet smoky cedar and Asian spices.",Balletto Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"Just what you want from a Sonoma Coast Chard. It's bone dry, crisp in cool-climate acidity, and elegant, with a minerally tang to the Meyer lemon fruit. Oak barrels bring richer notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Beautiful, and should hold through 2012.",,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Shows its cool-climate origins in the crisp acidity and powerful black pepper aromas and flavors that mark this very fine Syrah. The other flavors range from blackberries, violets and sandalwood to a distinctly meaty note. Beautiful now with your most upscale food.",Estate Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Baker Lane

US,"Beautiful and lush, with wonderfully rich flavors of cherry pie filling, licorice, rosehip tea, sandalwood and cola, with a dash of cinnamon, pepper and vanilla powder. Gorgeous now, and will develop for at least four years.",,92,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Here's a Pinot that's so beautiful and beguiling, it's perfect to drink right away. Feels delicate and silky, with lush flavors of cherries, cotton candy, bacon, sassafras, orange peel and dusty Asian spices.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"A blend of two Sebastopol vineyards, this Pinot shows the fine qualities of the vintage. It's bone dry and quite crisp, with complex flavors of red cherries, red licorice, cola and spicy new French oak. Really elegant. Drink now through 2011.",,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Dry and silky, it has ripe raspberry and strawberry flavors that are complexed with sweet green herbs and smoky oak. It's too soft for aging, so drink over the next few years.",Silver Eagle Vineyard,89,59,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"Oak barrels give this wine an edge of buttered toast and butterscotch, but it's not heavy, and the oak is perfectly in keeping with the underlying orange, mango and nectarine fruit. The finish is soft and honeyed, with a firm minerality that lends structure. It's yummy for drinking now.",,89,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"Very high alcohol has resulted in this dark, glyceriney wine being entirely dry, but also a little hot, and definitely heady. It's powerfully rich in black currant flavors, with notes of dark chocolate, tamari, black licorice, blackstrap molasses and black pepper, and the tannins are very firm, but ripe and refined. Should age for a couple years.",Hummingbird Hill Vineyards,89,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"A good Pinot that shows the qualities of the winery's Freestone bottlings, without quite the same richness. The wine is dry and crisp in acidity and elegant, with flavors of cherry skins, pomegranates, cola and smoky oak. Fine now, with airing, and should develop for a few years.",,89,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards

US,"With rich, spicy raspberry, cherry, tangerine zest and sweet cola flavors, wrapped into a silky texture, this is a pretty, polished Pinot to drink now. Zesty acidity makes for a mouthwatering crispness. Good with ahi tuna tartare.",,88,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.",,88,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Anaba
US,"This Cabernet-Syrah blend is made in a lighter, more acidic and earthier style than most red wines these days. With only 13.9% alcohol, it shows crisp flavors of dried cherries, tobacco, black pepper and sandalwood. Needs a good decant.",Dei Du Rocchi Ranch Fog Line,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Red Blend,Old World

US,"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy.",Fort Ross Vineyard,95,37,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"One sip, and all you want to do is sit back and reflect on this beautiful Pinot Noir. It's so dry and elegant, with crisp acids providing a silky balance to the wealth of cherry, pomegranate, tea, cola, mushroom, spice and balsam flavors. Great now and should develop for at least six years.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,94,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"Bone dry, high in acidity, minerally and stony like granite, with the essence of Meyer lemon and green pears, and a leesy, Champagne-like doughiness. There's toasty oak in the background. Elegant and complex now, and should ride out the next decade.",Stone Côte Vineyard,94,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"Irresistible is the word that comes to mind to describe this Pinot, which is available only in magnums. The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.",Precioso,96,150,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle.",Precioso,94,150,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"Here's a big, rich, extracted young Pinot Noir, almost Grenache-like in its full-bodied cherriness. Other interesting flavors include cola, sandalwood and peppery spices. Very dry, and wants some time in the bottle to soften and mellow. Best between 2011–2015.",Raymondo Vineyard,90,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Baker Lane
US,"Shows amazingly ripe fruit, offering a blast of pineapple jam, apricot, tangerine, papaya and lime flavors. The acidity is crisp and tart, and the oak is rich and flamboyant, yet in keeping with the size of the underling wine. Super-rich and decadent, this Chardonnay is at its best soon.",Fort Ross Vineyard,93,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
US,"Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific. Dry and elegant, it shows massively concentrated cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich coating of smoky sandalwood. Wonderful now, but the youthful power suggests time in the cellar through 2015 or so.",MK Vineyard,93,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",Charm Acres,93,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"Dark in color, soft in structure and rather heavy, this is a good Pinot Noir that doesn't quite rise beyond a drink-me-now polish. It has jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries and mocha. Drink now.",,87,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards
US,"Dry and tart, this young Pinot is marked by the oak, which was 50% new. It's hard to get beyond the caramelized wood, but underneath is an infusion of cherry and black raspberry jam. On the plus side is relatively low alcohol and vibrant crispness. Might develop, but it's hard to tell.",Petersen Vineyard,87,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"This is from the winery's Annapolis vineyard. It's a very fine and interesting Pinot, showing the acidic, elegant structure of true coast Pinot, and exotic flavors of wild raspberries, red cherries, licorice, sweet leather, tea and Asian spices. All this, in a lightly silky, eminently drinkable texture.",Far Coast Vineyard,93,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"Seascape is perhaps the winery's coldest vineyard, right in the path of the wind blast coming in off Bodega Bay. You can taste the Pacific chill in the high acidity that makes the fruit so pure and intense. The flavors, of Meyer lemons, lime zest and stony minerals, are bracing, and the finish is absolutely, thoroughly dry. This is a sommelier's dream of a Chardonnay.",Seascape Vineyard,93,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"The vineyard sources of Landmark's Grand Detour Pinot have varied, but the wine's quality is as high as ever. Made from five well-regarded properties, the '06 is intricately detailed, with complex flavors of dried cherries, red currants, mocha, licorice, sautéed mushrooms splashed with balsamic and smoky, vanilla-infused oak. The silky texture and spicy finish make it irresistible.",Grand Detour,93,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"Dark, full-bodied and extracted, this young Pinot Noir is a big wine. It explodes in jammy black cherries, red currants, licorice, cola, bacon and smoke, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Dry and moderately ageable. Drink now through 2012.",La Brisa,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"The winery's approach is to let the Pinot Gris fruit shine through. They put a tiny amount of oak on it, but it's primarily stainless steel fermented. Tastes fresh and crisp and appley, with notes of peaches and citrus fruits that finish thoroughly dry.",,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,MacMurray Ranch
US,"Shows the integrity of previous bottlings, but without the concentration or Northern Rhône-like quality of the last several vintages. The hot '04 harvest has made the wine simpler. Gone is the pepper and meat, replaced by fruit jam and chocolate. Drink this tasty, elegant wine now.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,87,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,MacRostie
US,"Quite a bit lighter in body than MacPhail's other single-vineyard '06s, this one benefits from the elegant structure. With its silky angularity, it offers complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange tea, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla-rich new oak.",Pratt Vineyard,92,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"High in acidity, this single-vineyard Pinot stings the palate with tartness. Yet it's packed with rich currant, persimmon and Dr. Pepper flavors, and is dry and moderate in alcohol. Although this winery has little history, the wine may develop bottle elegance. Try after 2009.",Suacci Vineyard,88,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"Rather strong and direct now, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. Although the wine is dry, it tastes sweet in caramelly oak and fruity extract as well as glycerine. It's a rich, flashy wine, but lacks some subtlety.",Jenkins Ranch,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Filled with cool-climate zest, it's light and silky in the mouth, with pleasant raspberry, cola, pomegranate and mint flavors that finish dry and spicy. Ready to drink now.",,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"Tough and gritty now, with dominating acids that give the wine a hard mouthfeel. Yet there's some impressive red currant, tangerine, ruby grapefruit and cola fruit in there. Will it develop polish and softness? Hard to tell. Decant if you drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"Grown from a block in the famous Hirsch Vineyard, this Pinot shows the difficulties of the cool vintage. It's too acidic. You'll find sour cherry candy and cranberry flavors, with an oaky influence and a delightfully silky texture. But the tartness seems destined to mark the wine for the rest of its life.",West Ridge,88,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch
US,"Made in a lighter style, both color-wise and texturally. Shows polished cherry pulp and cherryskin flavors, with orange zest, cola and anise adding complexity. Drink this drily elegant wine now.",,86,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Cellars
US,"Lots going on in this complex young Chard. It shows crisp, zippy acidity and a firm, steely minerality that marries well with the oak and lees to produce a coconut cream pie, macaroon richness. That's on top of the tropical fruit. Delicious now, and should hang in there for four years or so.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,91,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peters Family
US,"This is a dark, big wine, almost like a Syrah, and lacking in the subtlety and silky texture you want in a Pinot Noir. Its flavors are of blackberries, currants and cedar, and it's pretty tannic. But it could develop interestingly over the next 6–8 years.",Griffin's Lair,89,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Much different from last year's bottling, and better, but also more expensive. It's a big, rich, Rhônish Pinot that requires some age to calm down. Shows tannic flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola, anise, sassafras and sandalwood.",Hurst Vineyard,89,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Baker Lane
US,"Very light in color and silky in body, but rich and elegant in flavor, this is a fine Pinot. It shows dry flavors of cherries, cola, sassafras, cedar, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Drink now.",,89,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"The most full-bodied of Sojourn's new Pinot Noirs, a rich, thick wine of Grenache-like proportions. Although it's delicious now in cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and sandalwood, it's a bit heavy and tannic. Could emerge like a butterfly from this cocoon sometime after mid-2010.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,89,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"Released unusually at the age of nearly five years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit. It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake. Meanwhile the sweet, caramelized oak is fully integrated. Bravo to the winery for holding this back and letting us see what an older Sonoma Coast Chardonay does.",Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
US,"Winemaker Ross Cobb, formerly with Williams Selyem and Flowers, did his best, but this Pinot tastes acidic and labored. It has lean flavors of strawberries and raspberries and new French oak. The wine isn't showing well now, seemingly a victim of the harsh vintage. Its future is problematic.",East Ridge,88,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hirsch
US,"Rich in black cherry, licorice, mocha and oak flavors, this Pinot is showing its best now. Give it a few hours of decanting and pair with steak, lamb and salmon.",,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pfendler
US,"Oak dominates this wine. The idea seems to have been Chablis, to judge by the dryness and citrusy minerality. But the char and toast are very strong and the underlying richness isn't there for balance.",,86,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ernest & Julio Gallo
US,"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,86,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peters Family
US,"With some Carneros fruit blended in, this Sonoma Coast Pinot is a very nice example of cool-climate Sonoma County Pinot Noir. It has good enough acidity to balance the rich, exotic cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate, tea and cinnamon clove flavors that are enriched with the vanilla and caramel of oak.",,90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benziger
US,"Shows tart cranberry crispness in addition to richer cherry and raspberry fruit, but it's a fairly aloof wine now, with competing parts. Even though this isn't a single-vineyard Pinot, it needs time in the cellar, to let everything mellow. Give it 4–5 years.",,90,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A beautiful Syrah, dry and velvety, with a delicious array of flavors. Red and black cherries, beef jerky, anise and loads of crushed black pepper have a touch of smoky oak. Drink now with, what else, pepper steak.",Sonoma Coast Cuvée,88,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Baker Lane
US,"The vineyard was closely planted in 1999 to a mix of Dijon clones and cropped at one ton per acre. The result in 2004 is a bright, tightly focused wine, filled with red berry fruit and cedary notes from its 20 months in barrel. Drink 2009–2015.",Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block,90,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"This is a hugely flavored, extracted Pinot Noir, distinctly Californian in its ripeness and size. It's massive in cherries and raspberries, with hints of cocoa, anise, Indian spices and black pepper. With 60% new French oak, it's also pretty toasty. A bit ungainly now, but should gain in the cellar. Better after 2013.",Freestone Hills,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Lots of delicious, savory currant, licorice and mocha flavors in this dry Pinot that will go so well with a grilled steak. It's a bit soft and heavy, but enjoyable nonetheless.",Durell Vineyard,87,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Loring Wine Company
US,"Sweet in oak and simple, with jammy apricot, pineapple and gingerbread flavors.",,84,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
US,"A peppery, minty flavor and acidic tartness dominate this bone-dry wine. It's silky and elegant in structure, with a good range of cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors that end in a swirl of Asian spices.",Goodin Vineyard,88,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A wine that blends fruit from seven vineyards and seven clones, this bears a family resemblance to the more expensive Balistreri Vineyard bottling in its tart, crisp profile, although there's some dark earth and cola notes layered over the pie cherry fruit.",,90,57,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"A good Pinot that shows a fine coastal influence. Dry and silky, it displays flavors of ripe cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice and sandalwood, with a cinnamon and pepper flourish. Drink now.",,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"Beautiful Pinot, from this new winery headquartered in Dry Creek Valley. Shows long hangtime cherry, blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cola flavors, grounded in earthier notes of coffee, rhubarb and wild mushroom, and finishes dry and elegant. Would benefit from higher acidity, which limits its ageability.",Winemaker's Reserve Peters Vineyards,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"Starts off showing mainly raspberry fruit, then moves on to mixed berries, accented by vanilla from 20 months in barrel. It's slightly syrupy in texture, ending with supple tannins and a bit of cracked pepper.",,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"A full-bodied, richly textured Chardonnay, with toasty, nutty notes accenting melon and pear flavors. Despite about 70% malolactic fermentation, this avoids buttery excess, instead coming across as toasted hazelnuts and whole grain.",,90,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Fans of sheer volume will exult, but this wine, good as it is, is a bit overblown. It overwhelms with oak as well as berry flavor so ripe, it approaches chocolate-coated raisins. It is an interesting, well-made Pinot, yet would benefit from greater elegance and a lighter, defter touch.",Keefer Ranch,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lookout Ridge
US,"What a beauty, complex as heck. Starts off with meaty, beefy aromas floating above red cherries, vanilla, cocoa and smoke, and turns intensely rich and delicate in the mouth, offering waves of tart cherry, sweet rhubarb, rose hip tea and spice flavors. So silky and light, yet unstintingly focused. A real accomplishment.",Halleck Vineyard,93,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Displays classic cool climate character in the stimulating acids and brisk tannins. Is it a cellarworthy wine? Probably not. There's blackberry and cherry fruit, but this dry, elegant wine isn't built for the long haul.",,87,29,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"An intriguing wine, fueled by contrasts. Tomato leaf and peppermint notes counter honeyed fruit; grapefruit balances figs and melons. Despite the hints of green leafiness, it's rich and rather full-bodied. Drink now, although it may prove to be a pleasant surprise in another year or two.",Hummingbird Hill Vineyards,89,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Dry on the finish, but lush in smoky oak and pineapple meringue and custard flavors, this is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay to drink now.",,87,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"A dry, polished Pinot, zesty in crisp coastal acidity, with a light texture framing flavors of red cherries, cola, rhubarb and pepper. Drink now.",,87,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"The first thoughts on this wine are how young it is, and how much potential it shows. The immaturity lies in the primary fruit, acidic character, like a big gulp of fruity cola. But the wine's awesome future is in its vast complexity and balance, and the way it dominates the palate and lasts and lasts. A blend of several vineyards, it's high in acidity, with massive cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb preserve, licorice, earthy mushroom and cedar flavors. So balanced and dry, so elegant and powerful, so silky and complex, it is quite simply a very great Pinot Noir, and an early indication that the vintage on the far Sonoma Coast may be the greatest ever. Tasted twice.",Maritime Vineyard,98,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"Most of the grapes came from the Annapolis Vineyard, with some from Seascape. While the vintage was cool, it gave incredibly long hangtime. Dry, crisp and delicate, the wine has a silky voluptuousness that makes it irresistible, with pie-filling cherry and black raspberry flavors finished with Asian spice. New French oak adds toast and vanilla sweetness. It's expensive, but still a bargain.",Land's Edge Vineyards,96,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it.",Estate,95,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"A good example of a fine, ripe coastal Pinot, with bright raspberry, cherry, cola and cinnamon spice flavors that finish dry and crisp. The silky mouthfeel, with its light, gentle dusting of tannins, is just what you want in a Pinot Noir.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"Toastier and more buttery than the 2005, with a touch of warmth to its flavors. Grilled nuts accent melon and ripe peach flavors, showing a greater degree of ripeness than the more refined 2005. Finishes with notes of toasted oak and coffee.",,88,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Rigidity and acidity mark this young Pinot Noir. It's tart and a little tannic, but it has enormously rich flavors of cherries, currants, cola and pomegranates, enriched with smoky, spicy oak. Fine now with decanting and pairing with very rich fare, but should reward a few years in the cellar.",Pearlessence,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Soft and a bit heavy, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, anise, cedar and mocha. Delicious in the sheer voluptuousness of these tastes, but could use firmer structure.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"This is a new winery for me, and one to keep an eye on. They say the vineyard is 11 miles from Tomales Bay, which would put it close enough to the Pacific to get chilly winds and fog. In this hot vintage, the wine sure did get ripe, with cherry liqueur, raspberry jam, white chocolate and cola flavors, but is harmoniously dry, with crisp, balancing acidity and a rewardingly silky texture.",Grower's Reserve,92,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clary Ranch
US,"A bit sharp and rough at the moment, with a sandpapery, peppery scour. The flavors are of cherry pie filling and smoky cedar. Yet there's plenty of balance, and the ruggedly strong tannins suggest some cellaring. Give it a few years to mellow and knit together.",,88,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Guarachi Family
US,"Notable for sheer deliciousness, the way you can't stop at one sip but want more. Soft and gentle, with just a touch of crispness and oak tannins, this Pinot's flavors star. Raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, cola, vanilla all mingle into some fabulously sweet confection that manages to finish thoroughly dry.",Armagh Vineyard,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"Soft and sensual, this Pinot is a real charmer. With a texture as plush as velvet, it offers a tapestry of cherry, black raspberry, currant, chocolate, orange zest and anise flavors that go on and on. Best now for its sheer lusciousness.",,91,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"An intensely fragrant floral, ginger, peach, lemon-lime and orange-spice bouquet ushers in this smooth, well-structured wine. The palate shows intricately meshed orange, butterscotch and toasted nut flavors, offset by angular, racy mineral accents. Finishes long and crisp, with refined pineapple, citrus and stony flavors. Enjoyable now but still tight, this should offer even more in two years.",Laura's,93,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"One of the nicest California Pinot Grigios we've tasted. Pleasing, lively green apple, citrus, almond and herb notes play from aromatic start to bright, lingering finish. The flavors tend more to the Italian renditions of this grape, yet the fruit expression is all Sonoma. Editors' Choice.",,88,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Rancho Zabaco
US,"I haven't cared for this winery's Bordeaux wines, but with the Burgundians they're hitting pay dirt. This Dijon-clone Pinot is an excellent dry, silky wine with complex flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola, licorice candy and cinnamon spice. Unfiltered and well oaked, the wine offers something new and interesting with every sniff and sip.",Dunah Vineyard,92,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peters Family
US,"Dark for a blush wine, with a crimson hue, and forward and heavy in flavor, too. Shows red cherries, root beer and spices that are accented with brisk acidity, and finish dry. Not very complex or subtle, but easy with all kinds of summer fare.",Fort Ross Vineyard Rosé,86,14,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"Too sharp in acidity, with an aggressive mouthfeel. Other than that, the cherry and sandalwood flavors are fine, and the wine is dry and silky. But that tartness is a turnoff.",,85,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arissa Jane
US,"With briary, brambly flavors of wild cherries, blueberries and peppery spices, this is a rugged wine. Its tannins are a bit harsh. Could age, but right now, it's not showing much sophistication.",Fort Ross Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinotage,Fort Ross
US,"A spectacular Chardonnay grown in Failla's estate vineyard, high in the mountains above the Sonoma Coast, and open to the Pacific's cool winds. The pineapple custard, tangerine, lemon tart and mineral flavors are compellingly delicious, while crisp coastal acidity adds a refreshingly clean tang. This is a grand cru wine.",,95,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"This is always a tight, dry, tannic Pinot Noir due to its cool, low-yielding vineyard. The '06 is a very fine example. It's astringent and closed, but with a luscious heart of black cherries, red currants and Dr. Pepper cola. With decanting, it's fine now with something rich, like wild mushroom risotto, and should develop through 2012.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"My bottle started out with a funky, disagreeably cheesy odor that gradually led to a dry, spicy Pinot Noir, rich in cherry and cola flavors, and well-acidified. But that bretty smell never entirely disappeared.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,84,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peters Family
US,"This Pinot, from former Tandem partner Greg Bjornstad, defines an exotic, almost feral style of Pinot. There's a raw meat, bloody quality to the wild cherry, blackberry, forest floor and cola flavors that finish in a wild dusting of black pepper and Indian spices. Absolutely unique Pinot Noir, tight, minerally and tannic now, but endlessly fascinating. Has the stuff for eight to 10 years.",Hellenthal Vineyard,96,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad
US,"Tasted alongside its Russian River Valley sister bottling, released at the same time, this new wine from Sonoma-Cutrer founder Brice Jones shows far greater power. Just erupts with masses of sweet cherries and raspberries with a liqueur richness, and nuances of forest floor, pine needles and smoky oak. Really notable for balance. Citrusy acids and firm, sweet tannins give this Pinot, from way out on the Far Sonoma Coast, a brilliant structure. Beautiful now and for the next 10 years.",William Wesley,95,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Emeritus
US,"Marked by crisp, coastal acidity, this Pinot has a lightly silky texture, but the flavors are quite concentrated. Shows strawberry jam, red cherry tart and dusty spice flavors, an elegant wine of clarity and distinction. Not really an ager, but will hold for a good six years.",Peay Vineyard,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Here's a young, powerful wine that captures the essence of cool-climate Chardonnay. The vineyard is where Russian River Valley meets Sonoma Coast, south and west of Rochioli, and the wine is similar, in both tart green apples and acidity, with richer notes of tangerine, peach and papaya. Buttered toast, butterscotch and smoky vanilla are oak's contributions, in this brilliant, suave Chard.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,93,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"Doesn't smell or taste quite ripe and clean. There are vegetal notes, with just enough cherry and oak flavors to earn a passing grade.",Riviera,83,19,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Too acidic for comfort, with a harsh bite that's almost vinegary. Too bad, because the underlying cherry and cola flavors are just fine.",Numbers,83,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Adrian Fog
US,"Fancy, with racy acidity and rich oak framing ripe natural flavors of pineapple brûlée, pear concentrate and Meyer lemon essence. Rich, but balanced and elegant.",Oro de Plata,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller
US,"A nice, crisp and bone-dry Pinot that shows plenty of elegant class. Satisfies for its silky texture and flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange zest, cola and mint. Drink now.",,89,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Dark as midnight on a moonless night,with an impenetrable, mysterious aroma, this wine is nowhere near ready to drink, but it shows considerable promise. Teases with flavors of blackberry tart, black currants, mocha and sweet violets, and chocaholics will appreciate the dark, slightly sweet chocolate notes. Dramatic and complex, this Syrah should develop through the next six years, at least.",,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"Ripeness of fruit and tart acidity combine to make this a fine, drily elegant coastal Chardonnay. Beyond the great structure are savory flavors of pineapples and green apples, with rich notes of honeysuckle flower and a grounding tug of minerality.",,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ovation
US,"A lovely Pinot marked by crispness, complexity of fruit, and the hard-to-describe wild, feral attractions of the Sonoma Coast. With brisk tannins, the wine shows cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors, with an ineffable expression of wild thyme, sage and lavender. Drink this beautiful wine now and through 2014.",,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Heintz
US,"Part of the Jess Jackson empire of wineries, Hartford has a stellar record over the years across everything it produces, and this Chardonnay doesn't disappoint. It's bone dry and high in acidity, with a stony minerality that frames controlled peach, pear and mango fruit. The wine has that hard-to-define quality of elegant class.",,92,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"A wonderfully drinkable Chardonnay that shows brilliant coastal character and lots of richness, at a decent price. Crisp and dry, it has elaborate flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice.",,90,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
US,"A good, complex Pinot Noir that shows the dramatic structure of the far Sonoma Coast. It's rich in acidity and tannins, yet still is silky and gentle in the mouth. The cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors are delicious. Very fine now and for a few more years.",,90,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Here's a huge, flamboyant Pinot, dramatically young and vibrant in massive black cherry, mocha and cinnamon spice flavors that are wrapped in tannins seemingly made of pure velvet. It's eccentric, and quintessentially Californian. Beware the high alcohol.",Durell Vineyard,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Loring Wine Company
US,"A really good Chardonnay that shows the classic acidity and dryness of the Sonoma Coast, with complex, pleasurable flavors. Pineapples, pears, apricots and guavas are the fruits, enriched with sweet oak, in a dry, balanced and elegant wine that could develop bottle nuance over the next 2–4 years.",,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Hartford is a high-aiming, small winery that's part of the Jess Jackson empire. The single-vineyard Pinots are outstanding, this regional bottling somewhat less so. Still, it catches the cool Sonoma Coast qualities of acidity and elegance. You'll find cherry and green tea flavors, and the wine should develop over the next five years.",,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
US,"A well-made, delicious Pinot Noir. While it's a bit heavy for this variety, almost like a Grenache, there's no denying the wealth of cherry, licorice, bacon and cola flavor. Should hold well in the bottle over 3–5 years.",The Racing Line,89,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,The Line
US,"Released, for some reason, at the age of four-plus years, this Syrah is losing fruit and showing its age. It's dry and tannic and showing some vegetal, herbal bones, but with enough of a blackberry and cherry coat to get by. Not going anywhere.",,88,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"A very good Pinot for drinking now. With a silky-smooth mouthfeel, it has rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, anise, cinnamon and sweet smoky oak. Delicious and savory.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vergari
US,"Good and rich, but a bit ungainly. Sharpness makes it tart, and the oak stands out, shoving the cherry, currant, plum and cola flavors aside. These may be the marks of an immature wine, but it is very difficult to forecast this Pinot's future. On the assumption that balance now equals balance later, it's probably not an ager.",,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes. Yet the oak is heavy-handed, overwhelming the fruit with caramel, and making the finish too sweet.",,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Heintz
US,"Shows lots of the flavors and supple texture you expect from a coastal Pinot Noir. Dry and silky, it offers a range of cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, vanilla, cinnamon-pepper and sandalwood flavors. Turns a bit harsh toward the finish, but a good value.",Barrel Reserve,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Toasted Head
US,"Sharp in acidity and bone dry, this is a good, everyday Pinot Noir. It shows a properly silky texture, and flavors of cola, cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now.",,86,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
US,"After missing a beat in '04, the '05 reverts to the high quality of the '03. Made from Dijon clones, the wine shows a brilliant purity of cherry fruit, with rich, earthy complexities of mushrooms, forest floor, cola and balsam. Bone dry, it has an elegantly silky quality that cries out for the best foods. Best now and for the next four years.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
US,"A tough, leathery wine, very dry and pretty tannic, with pleasant berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. It's mainly Syrah, with 14% Cabernet Franc, and shows mouthwateringly crisp acidity.",,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Red Blend,Rumpus
US,"Tastes a bit tired, with apricot and pineapple flavors that are losing their fruity flesh, showing herbal bones. Dry and crisp, it's unlikely to improve with further age.",Les Pierres,84,41,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"Dry and crisp, but a little heavy in fruity extract. Shows direct flavors of apricots and orange meringue pie filling.",Marsanne,84,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Roussanne,Cline
US,"The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay.",Stone Côte Vineyard,96,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards. The crispness lends a vibrant tension to the intense flavors of Meyer lemons, orange blossom and minerals, while oak adds softer, spicy notes. Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way.",Seascape Vineyard,94,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after.",,94,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"A blend of various vineyards from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, and also Hartford Court's highest-production Pinot Noir. Always beautiful and balanced, the '07 in particular is remarkable for its silky tannins and overall seamless quality. Really excites for the complexity of currant, cola, licorice and cedar flavors. Now through 2013.",Land's Edge,94,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"From the winery's Annapolis Vineyard, at the cool, northern tip of the “true” Sonoma Coast, comes this chunky young Pinot Noir. Although the grapes were destemmed before fermentation, the tannins are significant, a reflection of the low yields and tough skins the berries develop. In fact, the wine is almost Zinny in its full body and spicy, briary fruit. It clearly needs time. Best after 2011.",Far Coast,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"Although it's forward in cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, it's a balanced, polished wine, with nice coastal acidity and a touch of tannins. Drink now.",Director's Cut,87,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Tastes like cherry-pie filling that got a little caramelized in the oven, giving it a Rhône-type note. Maybe charred oak contributes to the smoky heaviness. Either way, it's a distraction from the delicate, sensual silkiness we all want from Pinot Noir.",Pratt Vineyard,87,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",Estate,97,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014.",Pearlessence,95,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Delicious and appealing, a palate-flattering wine that offers a gorgeous structure. Waves of black cherries, raspberries, cola, sweet rhubarb pie, persimmon and pomegranate flood the palate, and then a crisp gate of acidity slams down on the finish, although the spices get through and linger long. Best now for sheer exuberance.",Liberty Bridge Split Rock Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
US,"With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour. Seems like it should mellow over the next 3–4 years, although not much beyond that.",Kanzler Vineyard,92,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"What this wine needs is more acidic crispness. The flavors are totally delicious, the texture is elegant, the finish is totally dry, but the superripe cherries, raspberries, cocoa and cola just sort of melt into the palate, then fade away.",Irene's Vineyard,86,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
US,"Some Pinots can handle high alcohol. This one feels hot and sweet, not in sugar but in alcohol and glycerine. It merits this score because the tart-like cherry, cocoapuff and cinnamon flavors taste good, but it really needs greater balance.",Gap's Crown,85,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Harrington
US,"The grapes are from the newish region just west of Petaluma, a chilly, windy area. The climate shows in the brisk acidity, while the excellence of the vintage gives savory flavors of cherries, anise and cola. Oak adds a fine touch of toast. Drink now–2013.",,90,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Morris Ranch
US,"Decent Pinot-esque wine, with good coastal acidity and a silky delicacy to the mouthfeel, but needs richer flavors. Shows suggestions of cherries, pomegranates and cola that are disappointingly thin.",Reserve,84,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois
US,"This is a best-barrels blend whose proceeds go charity. The '05 is a blend of Silver Pines, Van der Kamp, Chris Lee and others, and it's gorgeous. Rewards for its high acid, silky feel, so light and airy, and for the intensity of cola, cherry, pomegranate, smoky vanilla cream and Asian spice flavors that last on the finish. Should pick up additional nuance for the next four years.",Auction Block,95,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Showing the depth and nuance that mark great Chardonnay, this benefitted from its chilly location in the Petaluma Gap in this hot vintage. The coolness allowed the grapes to achieve maximally ripe tropical fruit, nectarine and peach flavors, while preserving vital acidity. Extra dry and elegant, it's a Chard that can take up to six years of cellaring without missing a beat.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"I love this Pinot for its dry silkiness, fruit, and the way it's so complex and ever-changing in the glass. Cherries, raspberries, cola, plum skin, mocha and dusty Asian spice are the elementary flavors, amplified by rich oak, but it's not a fruit bomb. It's elegant and complex, exemplifying cool-climate California in a great vintage.",Grand Detour,93,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.",,91,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Bone dry, firm in tannins and tartly acidic, this wine feels hard in the mouth. It shows flavors of cherries and cola, with a leathery finish. Elegant in structure, it may soften and sweeten over the next five years.",Stagecoach Vineyard,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"Shows rich, racy acidity in a dry wine whose flavors veer toward ripe pineapple-tart filling, cinnamon spice and butterscotch, wrapped in a creamy texture. Would score far higher if the fruit were more concentrated.",,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug

US,"The grapes simply got too ripe, and the wine suffers from sugary-sweet cherry jam flavors with baked  meringue, courtesy of well-charred oak. Those flavors are of course delicious, but the wine is direct and unageable.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,85,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Sparkling wine specialist Schramsberg ventures out to the Fort Ross area to tinker with Pinot Noir under its Davies brand. This shows intensity and concentration, with powerful raspberry and cherry essences that are compounded by sweet-tasting, smoky oak. Impressive now, but it should gain traction in the bottle over the next four years.",Nobles Vineyard,92,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davies
US,"This is a pretty Pinot that's light and silky on the palate, and comforting in its moderate alcohol and spicy, exotic flavors.

It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H.

US,"Complex and nuanced, this Chardonnay is beginning to lose its primary fruit flavors of pears and tropical fruits, and it's becoming dry and mushroomy.

US,"Lots of oak on this five-year-old Syrah. Too much, in fact, although it may be that the cherry-berry fruit is simply dropping out. Either way, it's a fairly simple wine, dry and tart and spicy. Drink now.",Coryelle Fields Vineyard,86,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Tin Barn
US,"Hard to keep from falling in love with this wine. It's so luscious in bright, spicy wild cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors. With a satiny texture and brilliant acidity, it's stunningly drinkable now, but should hold and develop over the next six years.",,94,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Lovely and tart, showing the finesse of this cool-climate vineyard. The flavors are of sour red cherries and cranberries. Tastes so sweet and savory, feels so vigorous and filled with life. Yet the mouthfeel is delicate and uplifted. With no new oak, the wine should develop over the next 8–10 years.",Hirsch Vineyard,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lioco
US,"This barrel selection, Keller's best, is an elaborate and complex Pinot Noir. It shows classic coastal acidity, with deep, delicious flavors of raspberries, cherries, mocha, licorice, spices and sweet sandalwood. The tannins are rich enough to let it age over the next six years.",Precioso,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"So good, you want to drain the bottle and ask for a second. With a silky texture and clean, vibrant acidity, its flavors range from wild cherries and raspberries to root beer and licorice and bacon, with a plethora of Indian spices. The touch of oak is smoky and deft. Drink over the next five years or so.",,93,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Rhône specialist Donelan ventures into Burgundian territory with this Pinot Noir, with good results. The grapes were grown in the wild Fort Ross area, and the wine shows typical cool-climate acidity and a feral quality to the wild berry, cherry and spice flavors. A fascinating wine that should develop over the next eight years.",Two Brothers,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donelan
US,"A classy, rich Pinot. It's delicately structured, with a transparent silkiness. Tight in acidity and also somewhat tannic, but showing great finesse, with a spicy core of raspberries, cherries, cola, lime zest and minerals. Drink now and through 2015.",Sea View Ridge Estate,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"A very rich, opulent Pinot Noir. It's almost as sweet as a dessert, like a cherry and chocolate tart, but it's actually quite dry. Crisp acidity gives it a balancing snap. Now–2014.",El Coro,91,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"This has slender raspberry and cherry fruit. As a result, the acidity dominates, giving the wine a sour candy tartness. In its favor, it's nicely dry, and it feels silky.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Casa de la Cruz
US,"Ripe, smooth and rich, this bears flavors of milk chocolate, blackberry jam, molasses and black licorice. The tannins are thick and supple, yet the mouthfeel remains firm. It finishes dry and spicy. This can be consumed now with roasted meat or beef stew.",Cinghiale Vineyard,91,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Del Dotto
US,"Clean, tart and expressive, this has flavors of Asian pear, orange, lime, vanilla and gooseberry. Bright and zesty, this would make for a fine apéritif, and it would also pair well with Asian fare.",,90,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Flocchini
US,"A very successful Pinot Noir that shows the splendid characteristics of grapes well grown in the far Sonoma Coast, on famed Goldridge soils. Acidity marks it, crisp and vital and nervy. Yet wrapped into the silky mouthfeel are rich, elaborate cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, pomegranate, persimmon and sandalwood flavors that are intricate as a tapestry. A great wine that should develop bottle complexities over the next eight years.",Chico's Run Doña Margarita Vineyard,95,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"Spectactular Chardonnay, so pure, clean and delicious. Defines the cool coastal climate of the Sonoma Coast, with brilliant, citrusy acidity brightening long hangtime flavors of tropical fruits, green apples and succulent peaches and pears. A stunningly good, upscale Chard to drink with very rich fare, such as ricotta cheese-filled gnocchi with grilled rock shrimp and Parmesan cheese.",Charles Heintz Vineyard,95,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Migration
US,"A very refined Pinot Noir, high-toned and elegant, with alcohol well below 14%. There's no lack of richness. The wine bursts with cherries, rhubarbs, pomegranates, cola and raspberries, wrapped into a silky texture, and finishing long and spicy. A shame to drink now. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",de Coelo Terra Neuma Vineyard,94,69,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benziger
US,"Shows brilliant acidity, so filled with life and nerve. Very intricate but also quite oaky (60% new), with an eruption of vanilla and sweet char. Underneath is a rich vein of raspberries and strawberries. The oak is just a bit too powerful.",Frances Thompson Estate,91,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"Give this Pinot Noir some time to breathe and mellow in a decanter. Right out of the bottle, it's tough, tannic and jammy in raspberry and cherry flavors. But it doesn't take long for it to pick up some complexities. This wine's rich, sweet oakiness will pair well with steaks, lamb chops and mushroom risottos.",Kashaya,90,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Relic
US,"This Cabernet has rich blackberry-jam and black licorice flavors, and it also has a funky bacon note. The oak provides a pleasant backdrop of sweet toast. This shows how well Cabernet can perform on the far Sonoma Coast, which is now  more oriented to Pinot Noir.",Mohrhardt Ridge,90,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"A heavy, dense Pinot that, despite considerable cherry, raspberry, strawberry and pomegranate fruit richness, feels a bit inert on the palate. Drink now.",,85,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Verve
US,"Big and flamboyant, an impressive Chardonnay whose flavors are explosive. Tangerines, blood oranges and tropical fruits are massively enriched by sweet oak. Coastal acidity provides a fine, minerally backbone. A complex, delicious wine. Don't drink it too cold.",Reserve,93,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Carr
US,"Big and bold, this Chardonnay is made from fruit sourced from the winery's estate vineyard in the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. This underwent barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging, and the result is a rich selection that offers flavors of lemon and tropical fruit, buttered toast and cream. Almost too assertive now, it needs a year or two to resolve.",Estate,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hirsch
US,"Here's a big, ripe and dry Cabernet with flavors of blackberry, molasses and dark chocolate that seem almost overripe due to a touch of raisin. Tannic and full bodied, it's too robust to drink now, so give it 6–8 years in a cellar.",Mohrhardt Ridge,90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"Rich and unctuous, with a viscous, glyceriney texture holding deep, opulent flavors of pineapples, lime custard, clover honey, Mandarin orange and cinnamon spice. Lees treatment brings a creamy, slightly sourdough tang. Good price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",,93,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"Dramatically ripe, offering tiers of cherries, black raspberries, blackberries and cola, with the toast and vanilla spice of oak barrels. Very extracted in fruit now, sweet and jammy, almost rustic, with crisp acidity. The question is whether it will age. The vineyard is exceptional, home to great bottlings from Fulcrum, Sojourn, Patz & Hall, MacPhail and Roessler, among others. It's a bit of a gamble, but try giving it six years in a cool cellar.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Expression 38
US,"An elegant Pinot with a silky texture framing delicious flavors of ripe raspberries and cherries, elaborated with sweet spices and smoky sandalwood. A lovely wine to drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,90,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"A brilliant Pinot Noir from Siduri; it's arguably their best of the vintage so far. Made from the highly regarded Hirsch Vineyard, it has a delicate body that explodes with flavors of tart, wild red berries, cola, baking spices and assorted forest-like notes—like pine needles, mushrooms and mulchy undergrowth. Just gorgeous now, and it should hold and develop over the next 6-8 years.",Hirsch Vineyard,95,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Big, robust and fleshy on the palate, this Pinot Noir is packed with cherry, cranberry and Dr. Pepper flavors. It should mellow in 6–7 years.",,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Wild Hog
US,"Tight, acidic and dry in youth, this Pinot has a don't-drink-me-now austerity. It resists efforts to break it down at every point. However, it seems well able to age, given the balance, and the wealth of cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and rhubarb fruit. Cellar this fine wine until at least 2014.",de Coelo Quintus Vineyard,92,69,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benziger
US,"Lots of zesty acidity and minerals in this Chardonnay, but also lots of richness. Brims with ripe pineapples, peaches, papayas and green apples, with extra levels of buttered toast and honey. A crowd-pleasing wine to drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,90,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller
US,"Estimating the ageability of a Pinot Noir can be tricky. This one, with hefty tannins, brisk acidity and loads of fresh primary fruit, seems to be ageworthy. Give it 5-6 years to let the structural elements begin to resolve and for the flavors of blackberry jam, Chinese tea, mushroom and spice to develop secondary characteristics.",Pearlessence,94,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Intellectual, elusive and challenging, this wine makes you think. It's dry, silky and crisp in acidity, with complex mushroom, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. It's also a little rustic, but time could help. If you're a gambler, hold it until after 2015.",Stuller Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Boheme
US,"This is clean and brisk in lemony acidity, and it offers concentrated, complex flavors of honeyed pineapples, limes, oranges and mangoes. It's dry and finessed.",,90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,MacRostie
US,"Rich and dramatic, if a little overworked. It's superripe in pineapple and orange jam fruit, with a strong application of sweet oak that layers vanilla and buttered toast. Brings Chardonnay to its ultimate deliciousness, but would benefit from greater nuance. Drink now.",Precioso,89,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller
US,"Dry and crisp, with a fine, clean minerality, this Chardonnay is dominated by the vanilla and toast of oak. The underlying wine shows pineapple, Asian pear and lime flavors. It's elegant, but a little thin.",Les Pierres,87,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"The flavors of cherry pie, sandalwood and spice are ripe and delicious, but this Pinot is a little off in the mouthfeel. It's jagged and rude. Decent, but ready to drink now.",Spring Hill Vineyard,85,33,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Waxwing
US,"Made in the rich, forward, jammy style, this boasts a flavor of black raspberry jam. It's oaky, too, with a veneer of buttered cinnamon toast. This is a Pinot Noir that's easy to drink now.",Durell Vineyard,88,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dunstan
US,"Rich in acids, ripe in fruit and balanced, with a silky texture, this is a very pretty Pinot Noir for drinking now. It has ripe, dry flavors of wild forest raspberries and cherries, bacon, sautéed mushrooms and cola.",Jeff Gordon Collection,89,57,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Jeff Gordon
US,"Held back longer than most Chardonnays, this single-vineyard wine is beginning to pick up bottle complexity. It's a connoisseur's wine, not dazzlingly rich and sweet, but dry, acidic and minerally, with lemon and orange citrus fruit flavors. You have to appreciate subtlety to like this artisanal wine. Should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,91,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peters Family
US,"MacRostie's Pinots from this vineyard on the edge of the Sonoma side of Carneros always are big, ripe, powerful and ageable. This '07 shows the fat, ripe character of the vintage, offering luscious raspberry, cherry, cola, red currant liqueur, bacon, anise, spice and sandalwood flavors. But it's balanced enough to change in interesting ways over the next 5–7 years. Really a glamorous wine for your best meals.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,95,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"Classy and delicious, this shows all you could ask for in the way of flavors of ripe tropical fruit and rich oak, with a buttery, creamy texture. With bright acidity and a firm minerality at its center, it's also structurally balanced and elegant.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Follette
US,"Buttered toast, caramel, vanilla bean, spice and pineapple and orange jam aromas and flavors mark this wine. It's a little sweet and white sugary on the finish.",,85,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"Dazzles with richness, offering waves of candied, tart raspberry and cherry fruit, Dr. Pepper, exotic Indian spice, rose petal and sandalwood flavors, as well as undefinable feral things. Absolutely dry and high in acidity, with overwhelming complexity, it's a milestone. Drink now through 2014; could go way beyond.",Hirsch Vineyard,97,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This Chardonnay, a blend of various coastal vineyards, is marked by high acidity and great dryness. It is emphatically not a soft, honeyed fruit gusher. The sleek minerality and elusive citrus fruit flavors have just the right touch of buttery, toasted oak. Drink now.",Russian River Ranches,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries. But there are also exotic and delicious notes of bacon, mocha and cola with a blast of black pepper throughout. The wine is full-bodied and dense in tannins, impressive from start to finish. Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,94,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,MacRostie
US,"A racy, rich and vital Pinot Noir, whose tart acidity and delicate structure testify to its cool coastal origin. The grapes were grown in a small vineyard close to the Pacific. You can taste the fog and wind that wind through the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. Drink now-2015.",Left Edge,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"Vintages of this wine have been variable, and this 2010 is like the so-so 2009, which earned the same score. It's an okay Pinot Noir, dry and earthy, but rather aggressive in acids and tannins. Ready to drink now.",,84,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
US,"A rich effort, this offers ripe pear, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Interesting notes of mushrooms and dried fruits are beginning to emerge, although that might indicate the wine's limited ageability. Drink over the next 1–2 years.",Cinghiale Vineyard,89,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Del Dotto
US,"Tough, acidic and tight in youth, offering little in the way of richness. So tart, so minerally, so dry. A wine that demands time in the cellar. Should reward the patient after six years or so, to allow things to resolve so the cherry, cranberry and rhubarb flavors can transmogrify. It would not be surprising for this wine to develop bottle nuance for well more than a decade.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,94,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"You can feel and taste the cool weather during this vintage in the citrusy acids, steely minerals and sleek, streamlined flavors of Meyer lemons and nectarines. Barrel fermentation adds needed richness. Good price for a dry, sophisticated Chardonnay.",,91,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"A soft, rather clumsy wine. Despite some rich, ripe cherry jam and spice flavors, it's too sweet and melted.",,84,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Meadowcroft
US,"Oaky and seemingly sweet, this is a showy wine whose appeal comes from its ripeness and richness. Vanilla and buttered toast notes from the oak dominate the tropical fruit and pineapple flavors. With its creamy, buttery mouthfeel, this is made to appeal to fans of the modern Chardonnay style.",,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"Clean, mellow and inviting, this bears rich flavors of raspberries and cherries, brightened by crisp acidity. Drink now.",Andrea La Rue,89,27,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flocchini
US,"Enormously rich and powerful, showing tremendous authority. Oozes ripe, candied raspberry, cherry, sweet cola, licorice, pie spice and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into ripe, fine tannins. Feels really toned, sculpted, with a long, dry, spicy finish. Drink now through 2014.",Split Rock Vineyard,94,43,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saudade
US,"The best of Belle Glos's 2008 Pinots. It's notable for the extreme richness of the raspberries and cherries, which have a jammy intensity with even more succulent notes of vanilla cream and smoky butter. But the finish is dry, while acidity and tannins bring the wine to earth. Delicious now and through 2014.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,93,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"This is an astonishingly good Pinot Noir that immediately shows the Sonoma Coast virtues of dryness, acidity, firm minerality, complexity and age worthiness. Flavors abound, with dominating notes of sour cherry, persimmon, cinnamon spice and sweet oak. It's rich and refined, pure, and a great expression of the cool 2010 vintage. Drink now–2020.",Occidental Ridge Vineyard,97,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Soft, simple and a little tired, lacking structure. But it does have a nice, silky texture, and the cherry, cola and spice flavors have authentic Pinot Noir character.",,83,26,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Jacella
US,"Rich and toasty, this has aromas barrel-dominated aromas and flavors of vanilla and sweet, buttery oak. The underlying wine is strong in cherry and balsam flavors, which are girded by considerable tannins. Pair this with game meats, stews or barbecue to wrestle the structural elements into submission.",Fort Ross Vineyard,88,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinotage,Fort Ross
US,"Shows the exotic power of the vineyard, with wild cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, and the crisp acidity of the far Sonoma Coast. But not one you want to drink now. It's tight, dry, minerally, aloof. Needs time. Definitely a wine to cellar until at least 2014.",Peay Vineyard,93,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Failla is so well known for Pinot Noir that we sometimes forget how good their estate Syrah can be. Given the vineyard's terroir, its red wines show better in cooler vintages—like 2010—while its above-the-fogline elevation encourages ripeness. This is dry, tannic and peppery, with a succulent blackberry flavor. Among the best Syrahs of the year, it's gorgeous now, and should develop over the next six years.",Estate,95,62,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Failla
US,"It's hard to believe that this fabulous Pinot is Failla's least expensive selection; what a great indication of his 2011s yet to come and of the vintage in general. It's bone dry and rich in raspberry flavor, with brisk acidity, firm minerality and a perfectly applied jacket of smoky oak. Elegant, pure and savory, it's just beautiful to drink now.",,95,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Not quite ripe, with a green, vegetal streak cutting through the thin flavors of cherries. It's a soft, simple country wine.",,82,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stickybeak
US,"The vintage was terribly difficult, with cold and rain everywhere, leading to widespread mold, especially along the coast. This Pinot seems to suffer from that problem despite some good raspberry and cherry fruit flavors.",,82,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roth
US,"Rich berry-cherry, cola and raspberry fruit flavors mark this young wine. It's dry and stylishly elegant, and shows a certain aloof complexity. Almost rustic in scoury acidity and tannins, but it could develop bottle finesse in another 2–3 years.",,90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"A very fruity wine, almost sweet in jammy raspberries, cherries, pomegranates and persimmons. Has just enough acidity to give it life and zest. Best now and over the next 4–5 years.",,87,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"This is a very big Pinot Noir, proudly showing off its muscles. Few Pinots anywhere achieve this depth of fruit. It floods the palate with the essence of raspberry and cherry, while plenty of new French oak brings even richer notes of toast and butterscotch. Despite the richness, it has a keen, silky vibrance. Although it is fine and impressive, it needs 5–6 years to knit together, settle down and get a little earthy.",Pastorale Vineyard,94,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Phelps
US,"The winery delayed the release of this block-designated Pinot later than its other 2008s, but even at four years old, it's still tight and acidic, a wine you really shouldn't open right now. Bone dry, it has a nice, balanced mouthfeel, with complex flavors of cherry, pomegranate, persimmon, tamari-splashed mushroom and oak. Hold at least until 2014.",Doña Margarita Vineyard Mas Cavalls Unfiltered,94,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"This shows the power and purity of the winery's coastal Pastorale and Quarter Moon vineyards, in this cool vintage that allowed for long hang time. Although some coastal Pinots were plagued by rot, this one was not, resulting in a wine with delicious raspberry and cherry notes, accented by new French oak. It's very fine, complex and enjoyable now.",Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown,93,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Phelps
US,"A huge wine, bright and bold in raspberry and cherry flavors, this has a jammy directness that makes it drinkable now, but such is the acid and tannin structure that it should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.5% by volume, a testament to the coolness of the 2010 vintage.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Phelps
US,"Feels a little brittle, with lots of acidity giving a sharp edge to the cherries, currants, cola and sandalwood. The guess is whether the wine will mellow with time in the bottle, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Drink now, with rich fare for balance.",Armagh Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"Dark as midnight on a moonless night,with an impenetrable, mysterious aroma, this wine is nowhere near ready to drink, but it shows considerable promise. Teases with flavors of blackberry tart, black currants, mocha and sweet violets, and chocaholics will appreciate the dark, slightly sweet chocolate notes. Dramatic and complex, this Syrah should develop through the next six years, at least.",,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"Seems rushed to market. The wine is still rough, and tannic and acidic, with fresh raspberry and cherry fruit flavors overlaid with sweet oak. Quite good and distinguished, but if you buy it, stash it in the cellar until sometime in 2012 or even 2013.",Split Rock Vineyard,90,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bruliam
US,"A very good, useful Chardonnay that's easy to drink, yet also quite complex. Brisk and crisp in acidity, it shows citrus mineral, green apple and floral notes, touched with smoky oak.",,90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,MacRostie
US,"Ripeness of fruit and tart acidity combine to make this a fine, drily elegant coastal Chardonnay. Beyond the great structure are savory flavors of pineapples and green apples, with rich notes of honeysuckle flower and a grounding tug of minerality.",,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ovation
US,"This is a lovely Chardonnay, a super restaurant wine list bottle. Dry and creamy, it offers pleasantly rich pineapple, lime pie, green apple, exotic spice and buttered toast flavors, accented with crisp, clean acidity.",Russian River Ranches,92,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"This exudes classic Chardonnay richness. Pure and heady, it explodes with tropical fruit and orange essences, with buttered toast and vanilla flavors from oak barrels and lees contact. Zesty Russian River acidity kicks in to provide perfect balance. The creaminess is delicious, suggesting shellfish in a buttery sauce.",Durell Vineyards,93,74,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ram's Gate
US,"Fans of ripe, sweet fruit will love this Pinot. It's huge in juicy raspberry and cherry, with spicy hints of Dr. Pepper and red licorice. It will be fun to see how the wine evolves over the next 6–8 years.",Gap's Crown,92,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir notable for the purity of its structure. Shows really polished tannins and crisp coastal acidity, as well as a fine coating of smoky oak. It all frames flavors of cherries and raspberries. Could be a little more concentrated, but it's a pretty wine.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"A lovely Pinot marked by crispness, complexity of fruit, and the hard-to-describe wild, feral attractions of the Sonoma Coast. With brisk tannins, the wine shows cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors, with an ineffable expression of wild thyme, sage and lavender. Drink this beautiful wine now and through 2014.",,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Heintz
US,"Every intervention available to the winemaker for creating richness has been applied here, including 75% new French oak. California Chardonnay hardly gets more extravagant in buttercream, smoky toast, lemon drop, apple butter and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Grown in one of the coolest areas of the appellation, yet it's so rich and full bodied, it almost has the body of a red wine. Don't let it get too cold, and pay attention as it warms and evolves in the glass.",Charles Heintz Vineyard,92,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Moone-Tsai
US,"This low-production Pinot Noir is dry, silky and enormously complex, with cherry pie, Dr. Pepper, bacon, anise and white pepper flavors, plus a woodsy suggestion of pine needle. Oak aging adds the perfect touch of smoke. Good as it is, it should improve in the bottle over the next 4–5 years.",Sangiacomo Vineyards Roberts Road,92,68,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Ram's Gate
US,"This shows real Sonoma Coast character in its silky texture, strong acidity and transparency of its raspberry and cherry notes, which allow for a mineral-driven taste of the soil to shine. The wine improves in the glass as it airs, picking up extra layers of complexity.",,92,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Reata

US,"Tons of fruit in this easy, direct Pinot Noir. Raspberry, cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and cola begins to describe it, further sweetened by smoky, caramelized oak. Rich and crisp, if a little one-dimensional. But it's a really nice dimension.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,88,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"This is firm in acidity, bracing in minerals and bone dry. That makes it sound austere, but you'll find delicious apricot, lime and citron flavors, enhanced by sweet oak. Drink now.",,92,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"Dry, brisk in acidity and ripe, this has stimulating minerality that undergirds the fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, lime and guava. But what dominates is the hugeness of size and the richness that goes on and on.",English Hill Vineyard,86,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Boheme
US,"Shows good varietal character, with cola, cherry and pomegranate flavors grounded with earthier notes of rhubarb and tobacco. Feels a bit soft in structure, lacking liveliness, so drink up now.",Lakeville Vineyard,86,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Amphora
US,"A lovely Riesling, made in the German style. It's dryish, low in alcohol, high in racy acidity and tantalizing in flavor, with suggestions of citrus fruits, wildflowers, minerals and a distinct touch of petrol. It's wonderful as an apéritif and fine with Indian and Vietnamese food.",,88,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Riesling,Davis Family
US,"A wonderfully drinkable Chardonnay that shows brilliant coastal character and lots of richness, at a decent price.

US,"A good, complex Pinot Noir that shows the dramatic structure of the far Sonoma Coast. It's rich in acidity and tannins, yet still is silky and gentle in the mouth. The cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors are delicious. Very fine now and for a few more years.",,90,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Good and complex in cherry, raspberry, orange zest and vanilla oak flavors that finish deep and long in a dusty swirl of Indian spices. A very nice Pinot Noir, although it's pretty sharp in zingy acidity. Give it a few hours of decanting before serving.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,89,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"This is leaner and drier than you'd normally expect from the Sonoma Coast, with lots of tangy acidity. Although the alcohol is high, the wine is shy on fruit, but it remains elegant. Drink now.",,86,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stephen & Walker
US,"A really good Chardonnay that shows the classic acidity and dryness of the Sonoma Coast, with complex, pleasurable flavors. Pineapples, pears, apricots and guavas are the fruits, enriched with sweet oak, in a dry, balanced and elegant wine that could develop bottle nuance over the next 2–4 years.",,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Here's a full-bodied Pinot Noir that's a little high in alcohol, but that's the cost of all the richness. The flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pie, sweet date and smoky, buttery vanilla are frankly addictive. Lovely pairings would be grilled salmon steaks with a fruity salsa or lamb chops in a wine reduction sauce.",Wildcat Vineyard,91,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A pretty Pinot, dry, crisp and silky. It shows polished raspberry and cherry tart, cola and spicy pomegranate flavors, framed in sweet, toasty oak. Drink now.",,87,27,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Cellars
US,"A vibrantly acidic, fresh young Chardonnay, clean and oaky, with sweet, candied flavors of tangerines, vanilla, minerals and buttered toast. Could be a little more complex and challenging. Let it breathe for a while.",,87,33,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bartz-Allen
US,"A little tough and gritty around the edges, a rustic wine rich in extracted cherry and blackberry jam flavors. Plenty of strong tannins and zippy acidity too. Feels unresolved, and the question is whether cellaring will result in improvement. Try after 2012.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,87,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peters Family
US,"A well-made, delicious Pinot Noir. While it's a bit heavy for this variety, almost like a Grenache, there's no denying the wealth of cherry, licorice, bacon and cola flavor. Should hold well in the bottle over 3–5 years.",The Racing Line,89,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,The Line
US,"A solid coastal Pinot. Shows lots of typicity in the dryness, crisp acidity and earthy, mushroomy flavors of cherries, and the way the tannins scour the palate. Drinks a bit hard now. Give it a year or two in the cellar.",,88,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roadhouse Winery
US,"This has been a consistent bottling for Landmark over the years. They took a price increase this vintage, but it's a very fine Pinot Noir. Crisp and elegant, it brims with flavors of wild mountain cherries, raspberries, cola, orange zest, smoky oak and forest notes of pine and chamomile.",Grand Detour,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"Combines rich flavors of blackberry, black cherry and cola onto and a full-bodied palate, with crisp acidity and some unevenly ripened fruit, which results in rusticity. It's a big wine to drink now with tuna, lamb and steak.",Flying Rooster Vineyard,88,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longboard
US,"This is a softly appealing yet ultimately simple wine. It's flamboyant in flavor, suggested buttered white toast, spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with cinnamon. Ready now.",Corona Creek Vineyard,85,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stomping Girl
US,"With some veggie and green, stemmy notes alongside tones of cherry and cola, this doesn't taste fully ripe. It's a very dry wine, with brisk acidity. Drink now, as it's unlikely to develop with age.",Durell Vineyard,85,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armida
US,"Ripe flavors of orange and tropical fruit jam abound, with a buttered toast richness from the oak. Its appeal is all upfront, with a simple, popular sweetness.",,85,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,16X20
US,"Too green and acidic for pleasure, with mint dominating the rather modest cherries and red currants. Sleek and elegant in the mouth, but the absence of richness hurts the score.",Rodgers Creek,84,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Picket Fence
US,"Simple and sweet, with sugared tangerine and vanilla flavors, enriched with caramelized oak. The blend is mostly Viognier, with Roussanne and Marsanne.",La Naris,85,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,White Blend,Sheldon
US,"Fruity and sweet in raspberry and cherry jam and cola flavors, with pie spices, this Pinot had no problems getting ripe. It has good acidity to balance the richness, but is somewhat simple, lacking the subtle elegance you want in an expensive Pinot Noir.",,86,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stephen & Walker
US,"Released, for some reason, at the age of four-plus years, this Syrah is losing fruit and showing its age. It's dry and tannic and showing some vegetal, herbal bones, but with enough of a blackberry and cherry coat to get by. Not going anywhere.",,88,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"A very good Pinot for drinking now. With a silky-smooth mouthfeel, it has rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, anise, cinnamon and sweet smoky oak. Delicious and savory.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vergari
US,"A very nice Pinot Noir that's likeable for its silky texture, crisp acidity and cherry, raspberry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, with a long, spicy finish. Seems at its best now, so drink up.",,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"This is a candied, slightly sweet Pinot Noir, pretty rustic all around. Its acidity and sugary finish give it a raspberry and cherry, sweet and sour taste.",Director's,84,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Francis Coppola
US,"A green, vegetal note marks the berry and cola flavors. It's a big, sturdy wine that's high in alcohol and slightly warm, with considerable tannins. It doesn't seem likely to improve with age.",,84,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Terra Valentine
US,"This Chardonnay has good flavors of pineapples, golden mangos, green apples and honey. It's pretty good, but one drawback is that the acidity is very strong, almost overpowering.",,86,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bookster
US,"Give this wine some time in a decanter, because right out of the bottle it smells a little dusty. After a while, that recedes into the background, and the flavors are very nice, suggesting ripe cherry and cola. Fine tannins and classic coastal acidity provide good balance.",Jenkins Ranch,89,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"There's a wildland, coastal mountain taste to this wine, which brims with bone-dry, exotic, woodsy tastes of wild forest cherries, fennel, balsam, cola, volcanic minerals, raw beef and Asian spices, not to mention the sweet veneer of sandalwood. It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",Hellenthal Vineyard,96,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad
US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",Pastorale Vineyard,95,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"This big, young Pinot should have been held back before release, because it's really tannic and primary now, making its future hard to evaluate. However, it seems a likely cellar candidate. It's fresh in acids and clearly has a pedigree of terroir, showing mineral-infused raspberries, cherries, rhubarbs, wild strawberries, and pomegranates, accented with rich, smoky oak. The texture is pure silk, and the finish is firmly dry. Give it until 2012, at the very least.",Bill and Joan's Special Selection,94,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"This is a very big, powerfully extracted Pinot Noir. It is not currently showing much varietal character. Feels like it was made by someone who knows how to make Cabernet, and brings that mindset to Pinot. The wine is full-bodied, thick, heavy and enormously concentrated in raspberries and cherries. Could change over time, but there's not much point in aging it.",,86,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stephen & Walker
US,"Good and rich, but a bit ungainly. Sharpness makes it tart, and the oak stands out, shoving the cherry, currant, plum and cola flavors aside. These may be the marks of an immature wine, but it is very difficult to forecast this Pinot's future. On the assumption that balance now equals balance later, it's probably not an ager.",,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes. Yet the oak is heavy-handed, overwhelming the fruit with caramel, and making the finish too sweet.",,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Heintz
US,"The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness. There are dozens of Pinot Noirs that are more drinkable now, but this is such an interesting interpretation that it deserves a place in your cellar. Try after 2013.",Pastorale Vineyard,94,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"High in acidity, with a nice silky texture and bone dry. It's a very good wine, but despite some modest cherry, raspberry and licorice flavors, it lacks richness, particularly at this price.",Rodgers Creek Vineyard,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"Made in a lighter style, both color-wise and texturally. Shows polished cherry pulp and cherryskin flavors, with orange zest, cola and anise adding complexity. Drink this drily elegant wine now.",,86,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Cellars
US,"Thin and simple, this is not rich enough to stand up to all of the acidity, lending it a sour taste.",Estate,82,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Jacuzzi
US,"Quite a good Chardonnay, made from Freestone's vineyards in the chilly southwestern part of the appellation, where coastal winds sweep in. Acidity and minerality give structure to the pineapple, honeysuckle, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors. Drink this elegant wine now with upscale fare.",,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"Oak dominates this wine. The idea seems to have been Chablis, to judge by the dryness and citrusy minerality. But the char and toast are very strong and the underlying richness isn't there for balance.",,86,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ernest & Julio Gallo
US,"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,86,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peters Family
US,"Undoubtedly the greatest Chardonnay the winery has ever produced, this is as rich as any Chardonnay on the market. Notes of tropical fruit, green apple and crème brûlée mesh with vibrant minerality that's steely, chalky and tangy. Although it tastes of honey, the finish is completely dry. This might even develop earthy, nutty complexities as it ages.",Pastorale Vineyard,96,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Phelps
US,"A bit heavy and dense in raspberry and cola fruit, with a curiously soft mouthfeel, yet there seems to be good acidity as you swallow. Could just be unresolved now. Give it a year or two to come around.",Sonatera Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Showing lovely silkiness, dryness and transparency, this is a Pinot to drink now or age for a while. The flavors are rich but elusive, suggesting wild summer raspberries, cola, pine needles and sautéed mushrooms splashed with balsamic, with the sweet smokiness of oak barrel aging. It's delicate and powerful, but only 47 cases were produced.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,95,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Furthermore
US,"Bone dry, minerally and brisk in mouthwatering acidity, this has subtle yet rich flavors of tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey. It shows real elegance and complexity; drink now–2016.",Freestone Vineyards,94,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Phelps
US,"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purée, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crème brûlée, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals. Exotic and delicious, it's at its best now.",Split Rock Vineyard,92,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bartz-Allen
US,"Smells and tastes overoaked, with toothpicky vanilla and smoky char notes. The amount of new French wood was 50%. The jammy raspberry, cherry and currant fruit just isn't intense or complex enough to support all that weight. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,86,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"This is a new brand from veteran Don Sebastiani & Sons, and it's a a bottle of easy-drinking deliciousness. Mellow and smooth, it shows cherry pie, sandalwood and white pepper flavors.",Sonoma Signature,88,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Don & Sons
US,"Sharp in acidity and bone dry, this is a good, everyday Pinot Noir. It shows a properly silky texture, and flavors of cola, cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now.",,86,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
US,"Sweet in oak and simple, with jammy apricot, pineapple and gingerbread flavors.",,84,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
US,"A tough, leathery wine, very dry and pretty tannic, with pleasant berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. It's mainly Syrah, with 14% Cabernet Franc, and shows mouthwateringly crisp acidity.",,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Red Blend,Rumpus
US,"This is potent in lime, sweet lemon, Asian pear and tropical fruit flavors, brightened with zesty acidity and enriched with notes of mineral and vanilla. Beautiful to drink, it will pair with everything from Thai food to risotto.",Hummingbird Hill Vineyard,92,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Cosa Obra
US,"Showing the richness of the vineyard, this delivers huge, flamboyant flavors of apricot and tangerine jam. While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.",Charles Heintz Vineyard,92,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Migration
US,"A gigantically flavored wine, massive in pineapple, guava and apricot flavors, liberally accented with 65% new French oak. Although it's dry, it may even have a touch of botrytis, to judge from the honeyed concentration. Defines a particular style, but it doesn't seem to have a future, so drink up.",Split Rock Vineyard,87,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Firefly Night
US,"A solid, direct Chardonnay. Doesn't offer a whole lot of complexity, but it's dry and creamy, with spicy, oak-inspired pineapple and green apple flavors.",,85,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"As delicious as Pinot Noir gets, this has fireworks of raspberries, cherries and cola, and a sweet, mushroom-like essence of earth. Then the depth kicks in. It's not a big, tannic wine, but rather soft, with enormous charm and immediate appeal. Drink now–2016.",Roberts Road Vineyard,91,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Acacia
US,"Deliciously soft and flavorful now, with all sorts of ripe primary fruit and new oak influences that are almost candied in their richness. Raspberries, cherries, orange zest, licorice, bacon, cinnamon, vanilla and sweet smoky sandalwood flood the mouth, firmed up with fine tannins. Best now–2012.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"There's a bubble-gummy, almost Beaujolais quality to this Pinot, which spent 15 months in 3/4 new French oak. It's rude now, with oaky, grapey flavors of black raspberry marmalade and Dr. Pepper cola. While it's dry and crisp and interesting, it's awkward. Is it an ager? Here's where crystal balls are required. Try between 2011–2013.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,90,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"Thin and dry, with oak and alcohol flavors modestly enriched with a touch of pineapples, green apples and minerals. Sadly, this is not the glorious Sonoma-Cutrer of the past.",Les Pierres,84,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it.",Estate,95,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"This is the tightest, most tannic and ageworthy of Siduri's 2007 Pinot Noirs. It's a huge wine, with a wealth of exotic berry, leather, teriyaki beef, Dr. Pepper, mocha and Asian spice flavors that finish entirely dry. Gorgeous now, and should slowly develop over the next eight years, if not longer.",Hirsch Vineyard,96,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"This wine is light on the palate, almost airy. The official alcohol reading is under 14%. Yet it packs the power of the world's greatest reds. Wild cherries and raspberries, with impossibly complex mocha, cola, anise, cinnamon and other flavors impossible to describe but endlessly fascinating. Gorgeous now, and should evolve for at least six years.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,96,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a big, extracted wine. It brims with cherry jam, chocolate and anise flavors, and it finishes very rich and sweet. It feels thick, soft and weighty on the palate, and it's fully ready to drink now.",Theriot Vineyard,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Bodega Rancho
US,"Rigidity and acidity mark this young Pinot Noir. It's tart and a little tannic, but it has enormously rich flavors of cherries, currants, cola and pomegranates, enriched with smoky, spicy oak. Fine now with decanting and pairing with very rich fare, but should reward a few years in the cellar.",Pearlessence,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Like the winery's other 2010 Pinots, this one's seems sweet and jammy in raspberries, cherries and cola, with lots of caramelized new-oak tones. It definitely appeals for its opulence, but would benefit from greater subtlety. Drink now.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,90,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"Like the tannic 2005, the winery's '06 needs time in the cellar. It's a bit hard and closed. But it's simply humongous in flavor, offering a deep well of blackberry and mulberry flavors and various wild berries with no names. You'll also detect dark chocolate, anise, Asian spices and beef jerky. Decant now, but best 2010 and beyond.",Coastlands Vineyard,94,69,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A very fine, ageable Pinot that shows a feral, exotic quality that is rare, but always welcome. Grown on the true, cool coastal strip of the appellation, it's dry and crisp in citrusy acids, with intricate flavors of wild cherries, balsam, maple syrup, teriyaki-grilled beef, licorice, cola and Asian spices. Such is the tannic structure that it should evolve over the next 8–10 years.",,94,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"Nice and crisp in coastal acidity, with a delightfully silky texture and ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb, cedar and pepper spice. Tastes a little sugary toward the finish.",Freestone Hills,87,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"As appealing as a dessert pastry, this has raspberry and cherry fruit, with roasted almond, sweet vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Not particularly complex, but it scores high on the delicious scale. Drink now.",Pratt Vineyard,90,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Rich in fine, pure tannins, this Pinot is delicious now, but has the structure to age. It shows ripe wild black cherry, currant, mocha, anise and spice flavors that finish with a smoky, oaky sweetness. Best now for its approachability, and over the next few years.",Hirsch Vineyard,93,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Very ripe, in the manner of this spectacular vintage, showing a blast of cherry pie filling, black raspberry tart, cola and smoky oak flavors. The acidity is firm and clean. Feels juvenile, with a jamminess that a few years in the cellar should resolve.",Akiko's Cuvée,89,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Notable for sheer deliciousness, the way you can't stop at one sip but want more. Soft and gentle, with just a touch of crispness and oak tannins, this Pinot's flavors star. Raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, cola, vanilla all mingle into some fabulously sweet confection that manages to finish thoroughly dry.",Armagh Vineyard,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"Quite tart as you'd expect from a coastal vineyard in this region, with acid-inspired long hangtime flavors of cherries and raspberries, accented with smoky oak. Tastes a tad sweet and fruit-bomby at the age of three years.",Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block,87,79,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"This is a very rich, elaborate Chardonnay, detailed with pineapple, pear, and apricot flavors, and a coating of sweetly smoked, vanilla-tinged oak. The acidity is brisk and fine. It's complex and impressive, yet its high alcohol and some overripeness suggest that it's not ageable—drink up.",Durell Vineyard,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Saxon Brown
US,"This is one of the winery's more elegant, sensual wines. What it does not possess in sheer power it more than makes up for in hedonistic delight. Racy and silky, it excites the palate with intricate layers of black raspberry and cherry tart, cola, Asian spices and smoky oak. The finish goes on and on and on.",Peay Vineyard,93,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Almost indistinguishable from a Premier Cru Beaune Burgundy, this Pinot, with alcohol of only 14.1%, is light in body, silky and dry. In the mouth, it shows a firm minerality, with cherry tart and spice flavors. A polished, subtle wine that should age well over the next ten years.",Peters Vineyard Winemakers Reserve,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir. It's so light bodied, so silky in the mouth, that the richness comes as a surprise. Endless waves of raspberry and cherry purée, gingersnap cookie, buttered cinnamon toast, vanilla and sandalwood. Just a delight to drink, and should develop slowly over the next 6–8 years.",Akiko's Cuvée,93,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Soft and sensual, this Pinot is a real charmer. With a texture as plush as velvet, it offers a tapestry of cherry, black raspberry, currant, chocolate, orange zest and anise flavors that go on and on. Best now for its sheer lusciousness.",,91,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"This is packed with delicious raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors. But it seems a little soft and flat, like soda left out overnight. Drink now.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,86,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Flavors of toasty oak, butter cream, ripe tangerine and pear combine in this dry, pleasantly complex effort. It's properly brisk in acidity, with a long, spicy finish of pie spice and vanilla bean notes. Don't drink it too cold.",Heintz Vineyard,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Von Holt
US,"Acidic to the point of sour, with a Lifesaver candy raspberry flavor. At least it's dry.",,82,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Copeland Creek
US,"Inky dark and full-bodied, this Syrah has all the hallmarks of a young wine. It's dry and extremely rich in blackberry, wild cherry and blueberry flavors, accented with smoky oak, violets and pepper. Really nice, but maybe too soft for aging.",,87,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Wine Spots
US,"This small-production single-vineyard Pinot Noir is dry, elegant and may be deceptively simple in its youth. It feels delicate now, almost fragile, with the suggestion of barely ripe cherries and cola that's been left out overnight so it loses its spritz. It's a wine of nuance, not power, and could easily develop dramatically over the next six years.",Parmelee-Hill Vineyard,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saxon Brown
US,"Very ripe and deliciously forward in cherries, cola, bacon, anise and sweet smoky sandalwood, with silky tannins. The acidity is a bit low, giving the wine a softness that limits ageability. Now–2011.",,88,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,95,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
US,"A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It displays the qualities of dryness and yeastiness, with complex flavors of limes, vanilla and a touch of raspberry. The mousse is very fine, while the acidity is extraordinarily clean and brisk. Beautiful now, and should age for many years.",Brut,95,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
US,"Acidity marks this ripe, delicious wine, giving it a tartness that works to balance the extraordinarily ripe flavors. Cherries, black raspberries, mulberries and pomegranates all mingle together, with spice and cedar complications, and the finish is totally dry and somewhat tannic. Great now, and should hold for a good six years.",,91,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Shows the crisp acidity of the coast, with the hedonistic ripeness of the vintage, to produce a pleasantly rich wine to drink now. Floods the mouth with raspberry, cherry, bacon, cola, pepper spice and sandalwood flavors.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",Estate,97,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014.",Pearlessence,95,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"The grapes from this vineyard in the Petaluma Gap typically get very ripe, while maintaining the acidity needed for balance. Tandem's ‘05 is richly elegant and riper than in the past, with opulent flavors of nectarines, candied peaches and pears, marzipan, honeysuckle, butterscotch and cinnamon. Should stay at its peak for several years.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,92,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"Broad and generous, this Pinot appeals for its lush flavors of black cherries, mocha, cola, sweet rhubarb pie and smoky oak. It's jammy and somewhat tannic, and should soften and sweeten with up to six years of aging.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Siduri should have held this bottle back for a year or two, because it's tight, tannic and tough now. But they didn't, so you'll have to cellar it for a while. It's a very good wine, dark, deeply flavored and complex, brimming with wild forest cherries, strawberries and mulberries.",Hirsch Vineyard,92,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress.",Clos Madeleine,93,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Notre Vin
US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",Estate Grown,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pfendler
US,"This is rich in pineapple, mango, honey and smoky vanilla flavors, with a creamy richness and bracing acidity.",Sonoma Signature,86,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Don & Sons
US,"Delicious and appealing, a palate-flattering wine that offers a gorgeous structure. Waves of black cherries, raspberries, cola, sweet rhubarb pie, persimmon and pomegranate flood the palate, and then a crisp gate of acidity slams down on the finish, although the spices get through and linger long. Best now for sheer exuberance.",Liberty Bridge Split Rock Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
US,"Arch and acidic now, which is this wine's main feature. It cuts across the palate with a bite, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever go away. Otherwise, it's dry, silky and rich in ripe wild cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",,87,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pahlmeyer
US,"A fine example of a Sonoma Coast Pinot, marked by bright, cleansing acidity and rich, yet modulated, cherry, raspberry, cola, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors. There's a spicy, silky elegance that makes repeated sips rewarding. Now through 2014.",La Brisa,92,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour. Seems like it should mellow over the next 3–4 years, although not much beyond that.",Kanzler Vineyard,92,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"Quite rich and full-bodied, this dry young Pinot is loaded with oodles of red currants, cherries, mocha and cola. It's a little hard and angular in tannins, suggesting midterm ageability. Best now, with decanting, and through 2011 or so.",Fort Ross Vineyard,90,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast.",,92,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"You might think of a Sonoma Coast Pinot as one marked by high, cool-climate acidity, but this is quite a soft wine. It's also a luscious one, marked by fruit flavors of cherries, currants, raspberries, pomegranates, persimmons and cola. The vineyard is in the eastern part of this sprawling appellation.",La Cruz Vineyard,90,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"A little thin, with bare-bones cherry, cola and oak flavors. Even though the alcohol is low, it shows through with heat. But the texture is silky and the finish is dry. Drink now.",,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani
US,"This is not a superrich wine, but it's ele­gant, fresh, vibrant and clean in acidity. It has flavors of oak-inspired cherry, Canadian bacon and spice. Drink now.",,88,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Corkscrew
US,"A very fine Pinot Noir that shows deep, impressively ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, red currant, licorice and Asian spices, with a rich coating of smoky oak. It's entirely dry, and has a brisk scour of acidity. Seems best now and for the next few years.",,91,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"Sharp acidity accentuates the tannins in this aggressive, dry Syrah, giving the blackberry and cherry flavors a jamminess that suggests pie filling. The official alcohol is amazingly low at 12.4%.",Que Syrah Vineyard,85,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Bodega Rancho
US,"This tastes soft and simple now, although considering the vineyard sourcing, that could be misleading. There's a core of raspberry and cherry fruit, with intriguing forest notes of dried pine needles and mushrooms. The acidity is just right, neither bright nor too soft. The wine isn't showing much now, but could be a sleeper. Try after 2015.",Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block,88,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saxon Brown
US,"There's a nice wine in here somewhere, but now it's cloaked under a heavy coating of oak and tannins, and the primary fruit cherry-berry flavors have a pie-filling sweetness. Give it at least 6–12 months in the cellar.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Irresistible is the word that comes to mind to describe this Pinot, which is available only in magnums. The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.",Precioso,96,150,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle.",Precioso,94,150,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"Succulent and crisp; those two words are what you want in a California Pinot Gris, and you get them here.

US,"The grapes are from the newish region just west of Petaluma, a chilly, windy area. The climate shows in the brisk acidity, while the excellence of the vintage gives savory flavors of cherries, anise and cola. Oak adds a fine touch of toast. Drink now–2013.",,90,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Morris Ranch
US,"The vineyard sources of Landmark's Grand Detour Pinot have varied, but the wine's quality is as high as ever. Made from five well-regarded properties, the '06 is intricately detailed, with complex flavors of dried cherries, red currants, mocha, licorice, sautéed mushrooms splashed with balsamic and smoky, vanilla-infused oak. The silky texture and spicy finish make it irresistible.",Grand Detour,93,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"Although this is from the Sonoma Coast appellation, it's high elevation, so the vineyard is often above the fog that plagues the lower Russian River Valley. As a result, the wine is quite ripe and forward in jammy raspberries, cherries, licorice and cola. New French oak adds the usual smoky, vanilla accents.",Clone 828,89,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"This wine's greenness shows that it's not quite ripe, but it's an interesting wine. Dry, racy and creamy, this is not without complexity.",Laguna Vista Vineyards Sur Lees Selection,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Quite a bit lighter in body than MacPhail's other single-vineyard '06s, this one benefits from the elegant structure. With its silky angularity, it offers complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange tea, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla-rich new oak.",Pratt Vineyard,92,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Nice, classic coastal Pinot Noir, showing a solid structure of acidity and tannins that frame opulent flavors of red and black cherries, cola and spice. Should hold and improve for up to five years.",Reserve,88,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross

US,"This shows the apricot jam richness often found in California's cool-climate vineyards. There may even be a touch of botrytis, although the wine is thoroughly dry. It's brisk in acidity and well-oaked; big and rich, it's almost a cocktail by itself.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,MacPhail
US,"Tastes fresh and jammy now in raspberry and cherry flavors, with a cut of lime acidity. One third new oak adds a delicious coating of sweet vanilla and toast. Very delicious and distinctive, but immature. Cellar it for 2–3 years to let it mellow and knit together.",Split Rock Vineyard,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blessing
US,"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. It's delicious and crisply elegant, with a silky texture, but a little direct and forward. Probably at its best now.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,88,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Here's a big, rich, thick Pinot that almost seems more like a southern Rhône wine, it's that dark and full-bodied. The flavors are ripe and jammy, of pie-filling black cherries, black raspberries, cola, anise and smoky oak.",Precioso,88,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"A cool climate has given this wine bracing acidity and gentle-yet-persistent tannins. Its flavors of wild raspberries and cherries, with spice and mineral overtones, are delicious. There's a feral quality that expresses umami perfectly, suggesting butter-sautéed, tamari-splashed mushrooms and crisped prosciutto. The oak is powerful and present in the form of toast and sweet vanilla, but perfectly balanced with the wine's volume. For all its richness, the wine finishes bone dry. Drink this impeccable Pinot Noir now through 2020.",Sea View Ridge Estate Vineyard,98,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Flowers
US,"This wine is an absolute joy to drink, and such a great expression of its Sonoma Coast vineyard. Its dryness, acidity and minerality highlight its terroir. Its texture is light and silky. Yet it's immensely complex in flavors, suggesting red cherry, licorice and exotic spices that are so rich, they're almost sweet in the finish.

US,"Made with Dijon clones from a vineyard in a cool corner of Sebastopol, this rich young Pinot brims with fresh acidity. It has complex flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, rhubarb, sandalwood and pepper, wrapped into a silky texture. Just a delight, and should age over the next six years.",Goodin Vineyard,94,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A harsh, nasty Pinot Noir. It's just barely recommendable for the cherries and silky texture.",,80,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Adler Fels
US,"Ripe and delicious right out of the bottle, although it will age well. Made from a vineyard on the true Sonoma Coast, in the remote Fort Ross area, it's fabulously rich in cherry, framboise and red currant flavors, with intriguing waves of anise, bacon and sweet, vanilla-scented smoky sandalwood. There's a foresty taste, too, suggesting dried pine needles. The tannins and acids are near perfect. Stunning now, and should hold for at least six years.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,98,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A brilliant wine. Racy in acidity, silky in texture, yet powerful, it exudes the essence of Pinot Noir's greatness. Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel.

The other flavors range from blackberries, violets and sandalwood to a distinctly meaty note. Beautiful now with your most upscale food.",Estate Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Baker Lane
US,"Seems rushed to market too quickly at barely more than a year of age. There may be something good inside yearning to come out, but now, it's all impatient berry jam, fresh acidity and oak, almost like a barrel sample. Should develop into a more nuanced Pinot by 2012.",McDougall Ranch Vineyard,88,47,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Drew
US,"Here's a young, dry, acidic Pinot Noir that clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has a beautifully silky texture, and is made in a light, elegant style, with very complex flavors. Waves of sour red cherry candy and cola flavors wash over the palate, accented with orange zest, cinnamon, Asian spices, anise and sandalwood. Better after 2011 and should develop for 3–5 years after that.",Hellenthal Vineyard,94,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar

US,"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins.

Shows the elegant acidity and structure of this wonderful vintage on the Sonoma Coast.",Balletto Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"Chardonnay doesn't get much richer or riper than this. Explodes with grilled pineapple, lemondrop, smoky meringue, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened and boosted by crisp, citrusy cool-climate acidity. Racy and clean and complex, it should develop bottle nuance over the next four years.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"This successful Pinot Noir from a difficult vintage treads an exciting line: It contains subtle notes of tomato and beetroot, but that vegetativeness only adds an earthy complexity to the ripe flavors of black cherry and plum.

Now–2013.",,93,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"This is one of the darkest of Williams Selyem's new Pinots and also one of the ripest. It's jammy in the intensity of raspberry and cherry fruit, with a savory, Dr. Pepper cola richness.

US,"The cool 2010 vintage has allowed Roadhouse to express its focused and elegant approach to Pinot Noir with great success. Black Label is a small-production barrel selection. Silky and delicate in the mouth, it features dramatically layered flavors: cola, exotic spice, sweet red cherry and ripe raspberry. It's a little hot on the finish, which limits its score.",Black Label,92,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roadhouse Winery

US,"What's so refreshing about this blush wine is its crisp acidity and the slight bitterness that makes it almost like a digestif. It has a wealth of fresh, green herb flavors, like sage and thyme, along with red cherryskin and white pepper. Complex and full-bodied, it can replace a red Pinot on hot summer nights.",Sofia Pinot Noir,87,17,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Rosé,Francis Coppola

It's a fine wine for immediate drinking, and the price is fair.",Hurst Vineyard,86,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Baker Lane
US,"Although new oak accounted for only 25% of the barrels used, the oakiness stands out in the form of buttered toast and popcorn.

US,"This is a dark, big wine, almost like a Syrah, and lacking in the subtlety and silky texture you want in a Pinot Noir. Its flavors are of blackberries, currants and cedar, and it's pretty tannic. But it could develop interestingly over the next 6–8 years.",Griffin's Lair,89,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler

US,"This is a powerful Chardonnay. It's explosive in tropical fruit, in malic acids and in new charred oak. All the parts kind of stick out on their own, going in different directions. It's a good New World style, but it should have more synergy.",Oro de Plata,85,26,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"Low in alcohol, high in acidity and ultra-dry, this Syrah is pretty severe in the mouth. It has a tight, citrusy tartness, with sour cherry candy and orange rind flavors. Give it a good, long decant.",Syrah du Soleil Coryelle Fields Vineyard Sue's Block,86,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Collier Falls
US,"A beautiful Syrah, dry and velvety, with a delicious array of flavors. Red and black cherries, beef jerky, anise and loads of crushed black pepper have a touch of smoky oak. Drink now with, what else, pepper steak.",Sonoma Coast Cuvée,88,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Baker Lane
US,"A bit hot and heavy, lacking the freshness you want in a new-release Pinot Noir. The flavors are of cherries and blackberries baked into a pie that got a little overcooked.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,85,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"The new oak really sticks out on this Chardonnay. It's toothpicky, with strong char and woodsap flavors that seem to overpower a nice, fruity wine underneath.",La Cruz Vineyard,84,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"This is a toughly tannic, acidic, dry Pinot Noir, showing modest cherry, cola and pepper flavors. The structure is elegant, but the wine lacks the immediate lusciousness you want in a fine coastal Pinot.",La Brisa,84,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"A good Pinot that shows a fine coastal influence. Dry and silky, it displays flavors of ripe cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice and sandalwood, with a cinnamon and pepper flourish. Drink now.",,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"Very good, but could be firmer in tannic structure, with a soft, melted mouthfeel. Yet the flavors are delicious, of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, orange tea, herbs, cinnamon spice and smoky sandalwood. The softness seems to limit ageability.",Peters Vineyard,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"Raw in acidity, this low-production Pinot offers cherry, red currant, cola and dusty spice flavors. Doesn't seem like it has a future, so drink up.",Griffin's Lair,84,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
US,"Smith's basic regional Pinot is a very fine wine. It shows the elegant combination of power and subtlety that mark a fine Pinot Noir, and the alcohol level is low. Dry and crisp, the flavors are of cola, raspberries, rosehip tea, licorice and spice. Drink now.",,89,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"A lovely young Pinot, filled with fresh fruits and spices, wrapped into a fine, silky texture. The flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola have a rich, meaty, leathery edge that adds complexity and earthiness. Good now, and should hold for several years.",,89,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Castle
US,"A tough, rugged, tannic young wine, brisk in acids and pepper, and not showing much opulence now. There's a molten core of blackberries and grilled, meaty leather, leading to a bone dry finish. Should mellow with 1–2 years in the bottle.",De Luxe,87,27,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek
US,"This is from a cool, southeastern corner of the large Sonoma Coast AVA. In this cool vintage, you can taste the fog in the crisp acids and dense tannins. Not a fruit bomb like so many others. Instead, a very dry, serious Syrah that requires patience. Such is the action-packed core of blackberries and currants that this wine should evolve over the next decade.",,92,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Lynmar
US,"Dry on the finish, but lush in smoky oak and pineapple meringue and custard flavors, this is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay to drink now.",,87,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"A dry, polished Pinot, zesty in crisp coastal acidity, with a light texture framing flavors of red cherries, cola, rhubarb and pepper. Drink now.",,87,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"The vineyard is near Sebastopol, in a cool part of this vast appellation, and the vintage was cool. The result is a lean wine with high acidity. The flavors straddle the ripeness line, with cherries and strawberries along with green tomatoes and rhubarb.",Peters Vineyard,88,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Anthill
US,"The vineyard is in a cool area of this sprawling appellation southwest of Sebastopol, but the heat of the vintage shows in the wine's relative softness and ripeness of fruit. The cherries, raspberries and dates are almost, but not quite, cooked, bringing to mind a Fig Newton cookie. Scores high on the deliciousness scale, but it's not a wine for the cellar. Drink now.",Thorn Ridge Vineyard,88,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman
US,"Vintner Carr follows up on his great 2008 Reserve with this delicious bottling. In California, it's usually a cinch to get fruit this ripe and tropical, and easy to plaster on lots of new oak. What's hard is to fuse the elements seamlessly. This wine does, offering waves of Chardonnay opulence. It may have a touch of botrytis, but that's in its favor.",Dijon Clone,94,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Joseph Carr
US,"Soft and a bit heavy, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, anise, cedar and mocha. Delicious in the sheer voluptuousness of these tastes, but could use firmer structure.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"Expresses the exotic side of Viognier's character, with tropical quince, lychee and pineapple flavors, and a mild sweet-and-sour apricot sauce finish. This rich wine finishes dry.",La Cruz Vineyard,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Keller Estate
US,"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak.",,87,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
US,"The brisk acidity and tough tannins suggest cellaring this Pinot Noir for a while. To judge by the core of cherries and red currants, it should ride out the years effortlessly. Beyond the fruit is a fine, mushroomy earthiness and a feral quality sometimes found in better Sonoma Coast Pinots. Give it until 2017.",Precioso,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"This winery has a good track record for producing rich, opulent Chardonnays. The cool 2010 vintage was beneficial, yielding a low alcohol wine with extraordinarily rich tropical fruit flavors and bright, graceful acidity. It saw a majority of new French oak, lending it a note of buttered toast, but the underlying wine is so big, it easily handles that weight.",Gold Ridge Hills,93,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Oak dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and butterscotch notes offering an immediate impact. Underneath the oak tones are very rich, opulent flavors of pineapple and orange jam and lime tart. It's a bit jumbled now, but this may be a Chardonnay that can take some cellaring. Give it 3–4 years.",,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Carte Blanche
US,"Big, rich and heavy in its youth, this Pinot has a Rhône-like feeling; its cherry and currant flavors suggest Grenache. Yet for that style, it's a good wine, showing cherry, currant and pine cone flavors that lend interest. A smoky grilled steak or pork will negociate its tannins, but you might want to age it for up to eight years.",Doña Margarita Vineyard,91,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"Good and dry, with a fine oak edge to the fruit and a delicately silky structure, but there's just too much of a cooked or taste, especially in the finish. It's like the cherries were plumped, diluting the flavors, and even though alcohol is low, it tastes hot.",Umino Vineyard,86,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"Acidic and gritty. Despite some good raspberry-cherry flavors and sweet oak, this Pinot is hard to like, lacking richness and opulence. Drink now.",Grand Detour,84,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"An awkward wine, tough and gritty in tannins, with green, mint tea flavors alongside the cherries and cola. Good, but lacks charm and richness. Drink now.",Reserve,85,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
US,"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
US,"Nothing charming about this wine, which is sweet, acidic and fruity, like a Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy. Pretty expensive for what you get.",Charm Acres,83,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"There's no doubting this is a rich wine. It's flamboyant in jammy cherry, boysenberry and cola flavors, while oak adds pronounced char and vanilla. It's the most expensive wine ever released by the winery, but tasty as it is, it's sweet and simple. Tasted four times.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,86,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Very rich and elegantly structured, this shows the talented viticulture and superior winemaking. Bone dry, it has powerful flavors of cherry pie filling, cola and pomegranate, with a mouthwatering spiciness. The acidity is notable. Try pairing this with a salted and peppered steak.",La Cruz Vineyard,92,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"Dry, streamlined and acidic, with suggestions of peaches, apples, vanilla, cream and cinnamon. A decent everyday Chardonnay with a touch of smoky oak.",,84,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"A dazzlingly good Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the precision of flavor and structure. Shows the massively ripe character of the vintage, with a starburst of raspberries, cherries, cola, minerals and spices, while the acidity and tannins are just about perfect. This crowd pleaser is just extraordinary now, and should develop in the bottle over the next six years.",Precioso,95,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.",Precioso,95,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak. Packed with raspberries and cherries, the wine is completely dry and firm in minerals, and seems easily able to age for at least six years. Only 120 cases were produced.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,94,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"Rich and ripe in fruit and oak, this dry Pinot has cherry, cola, plum, balsam and smoky vanilla flavors. It's a little too soft in acidity, though, which makes it feel simple.",La Cruz Vineyard,85,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"An awkward Chardonnay that's too strong and exaggerated for balance. Shows New World flavors of superripe pineapple jam and vanilla custard, with a honey-sweet finish.",Peters Vineyard,83,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kokomo
US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
US,"Anyone who doesn't love this Pinot just doesn't understand California's approach. It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity. Just beautiful, and it grows better as it warms in the glass. Probably not an ager, but wonderful now and through 2013.",Burnside Vineyard,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
US,"Another terrific wine from this vineyard, following the superb '07. May be a bit less flamboyant, but with better structure, and equally ageable. Dry and full bodied and fairly tannic, it shows powerful cherry and raspberry fruit, smoked meat, sautéed wild mushroom and sandalwood flavors, liberally spiced. Drinkable now, and should develop through 2014, at least.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,Disagreeable for its harsh acidity and vegetal streak that mars the cherries and suggests a bitter green herb. Disappointing.,,82,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"This young, impetuous Pinot Noir needs time in the cellar to calm down. It's all about fresh acidity of the citrus kind and ripe, jammy cherry and raspberry fruit, not to mention sweet, unintegrated oak. Give it a good four years.",,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kanzler
US,"This single-vineyard Pinot doesn't have the firm dryness you expect of a Pinot Noir from this appellation, but instead collapses in sugary, simple raspberry and cherry jelly flavors. Regains a point or two for silkiness.",Kastania Vineyard,84,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WillowBrook Cellars
US,"This is an okay wine, dry and silky, but it's just too cooked or stewed. Even out on the coast, the vintage was brutally hot, and you can taste how those grapes shriveled into raisins. There should be better results in '05 and '06.",,84,29,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Cellars
US,"This small- production wine showcases the wild, feral and lonely personality of this winery's extreme coastal mountain location, offering the most exotic flavors that are hard to describe. Asian pears, pomegranates, Dr. Pepper cola, red currants, licorice, bacon and rare berries like mulberries and loganberries come to mind. It's softly delicious and drinkable now, yet has a firm acidic structure that suggests aging into the future. It will be fascinating to watch this wine develop over the next decade.",Vivien,97,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Made in a light-bodied, lower-alcohol style, this Pinot feels silky and gentle in the mouth. It really delivers when it comes to flavor. Displays big, impressive notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood that are complex and satisfying, and that finish entirely dry. Drink now and over the next four years.",La Cruz Vineyard,92,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"This tremendous Syrah is one for the cellar. It's explosive in flavor, offering a mouthblast of peppery blackberries, roasted meat, red licorice, pomegranates and smoky cedar. There are even suggestions of dark chocolate, cassis and minerals as well as sweetness, although it's absolutely dry. It has the most beautiful tannin-acid balance that launches it into classic territory. This superlative Syrah, among the greatest in California, should hit its stride after 2010.",Estate Vineyard,96,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Failla
US,"Acidic and tight now, a young wine that's clearly not ready for current drinking. It needs time to knit together and mellow. But such is the balance of all the parts that it should easily negotiate through at least 2015, when the cherries, berries, cola, bacon, earth, exotic spices and sweet oak should meld. An exciting, promising Pinot Noir.",Occidental Ridge Vineyard,95,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"This is a blend of several vineyards from throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast region. It shows crisp, upfront acidity that makes the wine tart, and lasts through the dry finish. Flavor-wise, it's all about pears, enriched with toasty oak.",Golden Coast,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"What's so nice about this Chardonnay is the way the dryness, acidity and minerality combine with tropical fruit to make for a splendid, Chablis-style California wine. It's a connoisseur's Chardonnay, requiring some understanding of structure. Don't drink it too cold; could even stand a brief decant at room temperature.",,91,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,91,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Expression 38
US,"A spectacular Chardonnay grown in Failla's estate vineyard, high in the mountains above the Sonoma Coast, and open to the Pacific's cool winds. The pineapple custard, tangerine, lemon tart and mineral flavors are compellingly delicious, while crisp coastal acidity adds a refreshingly clean tang. This is a grand cru wine.",,95,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"You can taste the racy acidity and minerality of the cool Sonoma Coast in this silky, bone-dry Pinot. The cola, cherry, raspberry and spice flavors are pretty and polished. This is a good price for a coastal Pinot of this elegance.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani
US,"Here's one for the cellar. It's rich and ripe, yet the firm tannins and crisp acidity argue for time. Shows a complex heart of black cherries, red currants, cola, leather and smoky sandalwood that is frankly delicious. But the finish turns hard. Give it until 2011 to begin to show its stuff.",Pratt Vineyard,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"You'll need to give this young pup some years in the cellar, because as constructed, it's tough and hard. The acids and tannins stand out, while the fruit and oak have not been integrated. But it's an enormously rich, complicated Pinot Noir, offering tiers of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates, licorice, orange peel and sweet smoky oak, and the texture is pure silk. Better after 2011 and through 2014.",Hirsch Vineyard,94,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"An enormously elegant, complex Pinot Noir that changes endlessly in the glass and is a joy to drink. Completely dry, and marked by silky tannins, it shows complicated cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, orange tea and sandalwood flavors. First class. Best now and for the next four or five years.",,94,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Simple and fruity, this Syrah has ripe cherry and chocolate flavors and a layer of caramelized oak. The finish is sugary.",La Cruz Vineyard,83,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"This is always a tight, dry, tannic Pinot Noir due to its cool, low-yielding vineyard. The '06 is a very fine example. It's astringent and closed, but with a luscious heart of black cherries, red currants and Dr. Pepper cola. With decanting, it's fine now with something rich, like wild mushroom risotto, and should develop through 2012.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",,90,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Expression 38
US,"Way too sweet, this tastes like a couple spoons of white sugar were added to a wine that already had good pineapple flavors.",,82,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
US,"Expensive, but a perfect Pinot Noir to drink now for sheer luxury and decadence. Tastes so good, offering a tapestry of raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and sweet, smoky sandalwood. With finely ground tannins and near-perfect coastal acidity, it's addictively likeable. Now–2012.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"I love this wine for its balance and dryness. The texture is velvety-silky and gently tannic, while the flavors are complex, suggesting red cherries with the astringent skins, mashed black raspberries, tangerines, cola, root beer, dark unsweetened chocolate, a touch of cassis liqueur, and something earthy, like Portobello mushrooms. This is really a gorgeous Pinot Noir that will develop over the next five years or so.",Doña Margarita Vineyard,96,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"Marked by big, sharp acidity, like biting into a lime, and clean, linear flavors of limes, green apples and pineapples, this bone-dry Chardonnay badly needs food to balance it out. Think of bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, or a spicy Ahi tuna tartare dish.",,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Released at the age of one year, which is disappointing as the wine will surely gain in the bottle. It's young and acidic and fruity, with complex waves of cherries, red currants, beef tartare, sautéed wild mushrooms with a splash of soy and balsamic, orange zest, pepper and the sweet sandalwood of smoky oak. Very fine, but needs at least a year in the bottle.",Hellenthal Vineyard,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"What a wonderful Pinot Noir, a joy to sip as it warms and changes in the glass. It's a very young wine, dry, sappy and acidic, with a tremendous depth of cherry preserves, licorice, cocoa, oaky spice and something wild and mushroomy that comes from the earth. As good as it is now, it should improve for a decade.",McDougall Vineyard,95,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy.",Fort Ross Vineyard,95,37,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"This is an impressive young Pinot Noir that's not particularly nuanced now, but could develop bottle complexity over the next 4–6 years. It's dry, silky and tart, and marked by hugely ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, orange zest and smoky oak. The fact that it grows better in the glass is a positive indicator of ageability.",El Coro,92,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
US,"A bit tannic and earthy, with tobacco and cola flavors accenting the fruitier cherries and blackberries. Oak adds sweet, smoky notes of toast, and the finish includes lots of tangy spices. Elegantly constructed, this young Pinot needs a few year in the cellar.",,92,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Shows amazingly ripe fruit, offering a blast of pineapple jam, apricot, tangerine, papaya and lime flavors. The acidity is crisp and tart, and the oak is rich and flamboyant, yet in keeping with the size of the underling wine. Super-rich and decadent, this Chardonnay is at its best soon.",Fort Ross Vineyard,93,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
US,"Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific. Dry and elegant, it shows massively concentrated cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich coating of smoky sandalwood. Wonderful now, but the youthful power suggests time in the cellar through 2015 or so.",MK Vineyard,93,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",Charm Acres,93,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"This is the first Pinot from the Napa house of Pahlmeyer, the result of many years of effort in his vineyard in the Fort Ross area of the true Sonoma Coast. The result is rich in cherry pie, raspberry liqueur, cotton candy, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon flavors that captivate from sip one, but there's a certain young vine simple directness that limits the score. As the vines age, the wine is one to watch.",,92,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Jayson
US,"Marked by crisp, coastal acidity, this Pinot has a lightly silky texture, but the flavors are quite concentrated. Shows strawberry jam, red cherry tart and dusty spice flavors, an elegant wine of clarity and distinction. Not really an ager, but will hold for a good six years.",Peay Vineyard,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"A challenging wine. It's rather strong and dry and extracted now, lacking delicacy, and makes you want to stick it in the cellar for a while. Yet there's a certain hollowness that may limit ageability. If you drink it now, give it a good decant.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
US,"Tin Barn has a pretty good record at making a Northern Rhône-style Syrah. This wine has deliciously dry, peppery flavors of ripe blackberries, currants and minerals. But what it could use is better structure, especially acidity.",Coryelle Fields Vineyard,86,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Tin Barn
US,"There's a very good wine in here, but the winery has released it far too early, which shifts the burden of cellaring to the buyer. Right now it's all primary fruit, acidity and oak. But the fruit is beautifully layered in tiers of roasted blackberries, grilled cherries and cola, and the oak is splendid. This dry, silky wine desperately needs to be held until at least late 2010, and should drink well through 2014.",Maritime,92,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"One of the richer Pinots out there, just packed with ripe raspberries and cherries, like the filling in a pie. Shows great, cool-climate acidity, and the texture is as light and silky as can be. Defines the best of a drink-now style.",,89,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"Here's a pretty, polished Pinot for drinking now with a nice steak. It's dry and silky, with good varietal flavors of cherries, cola, rhubarb, grilled mushrooms and smoky oak, finished with dusty spices. There's even a touch of barnyard.",Bella Luna Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,86,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Fancy, with racy acidity and rich oak framing ripe natural flavors of pineapple brûlée, pear concentrate and Meyer lemon essence. Rich, but balanced and elegant.",Oro de Plata,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller
US,"Very dry and pretty tannic, this cool-climate Syrah combines its blackberry and cherry fruit with less ripe notes of herbs and even a touch of asparagus. Intense umami flavors of salty, smoky bacon give it richness. Drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,88,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"A nice, crisp and bone-dry Pinot that shows plenty of elegant class. Satisfies for its silky texture and flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange zest, cola and mint. Drink now.",,89,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Not very attractive now, a heavy, full-bodied wine that hasn't come together. Could almost be Grenache. Yet it's enormously complex, and the flavors veer toward ripe blackberries, cherries, blueberries, cranberries, orange peel, anise, cola and sweet, smoky new oak. The toughness should benefit from time in the bottle. Give it a good 4–6 years.",Estate Vineyard,91,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Released unusually at the age of nearly five years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit. It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake. Meanwhile the sweet, caramelized oak is fully integrated. Bravo to the winery for holding this back and letting us see what an older Sonoma Coast Chardonay does.",Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
US,"A little on the sweet and soft side, with Dr. Pepper and cherry-black raspberry cream flavors, enriched with vanilla, and finished with caramelized oak. This silky-textured wine is to open now.",,85,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MooBuzz
US,"Rather heavy and lifeless, but rescued by the pretty black cherry, cola and spice flavors, and a silky mouthfeel. Finishes dry and oaky.",Herrerias Vineyard,84,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Adobe Road
US,"Shows tart cranberry crispness in addition to richer cherry and raspberry fruit, but it's a fairly aloof wine now, with competing parts. Even though this isn't a single-vineyard Pinot, it needs time in the cellar, to let everything mellow. Give it 4–5 years.",,90,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a hugely flavored, extracted Pinot Noir, distinctly Californian in its ripeness and size. It's massive in cherries and raspberries, with hints of cocoa, anise, Indian spices and black pepper. With 60% new French oak, it's also pretty toasty. A bit ungainly now, but should gain in the cellar. Better after 2013.",Freestone Hills,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Here's a tight, acidic young Chard from this cool-climate appellation. It's showing lots of mineral flavors now, against a background of Meyer lemon and apricot, and the finish is totally dry.",Pacheco Vineyard,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kinter Collins
US,"Smells fresh and invigorating, but in the mouth it has raisiny flavors. This is a young Pinot, rich in acids and tannins, but that overripe quality limits ageability and makes the wine a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,85,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"After missing a beat in '04, the '05 reverts to the high quality of the '03. Made from Dijon clones, the wine shows a brilliant purity of cherry fruit, with rich, earthy complexities of mushrooms, forest floor, cola and balsam. Bone dry, it has an elegantly silky quality that cries out for the best foods. Best now and for the next four years.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
US,"High in acids and dry, this wine has a sharp bite. It's big in blackberry jam and cherry jelly flavors, with a smooth, velvety texture and a rustic finish.",Cool Climate,84,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Cline
US,"A bit sharp and rough at the moment, with a sandpapery, peppery scour. The flavors are of cherry pie filling and smoky cedar. Yet there's plenty of balance, and the ruggedly strong tannins suggest some cellaring. Give it a few years to mellow and knit together.",,88,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Guarachi Family
US,"The vineyard is in the extreme, “true” Sonoma Coast, and it requires a warmer year to fully ripen. This is showing a minty, herbal edge to the cherries and blackberries, and high acidity. It's impossible to make a wine that isn't charming and elegant from this vineyard, but this bottling for all its appeal is not a great success or ageable. Drink now.",McDougall Vineyard,88,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"One of the nicest California Pinot Grigios we've tasted. Pleasing, lively green apple, citrus, almond and herb notes play from aromatic start to bright, lingering finish. The flavors tend more to the Italian renditions of this grape, yet the fruit expression is all Sonoma. Editors' Choice.",,88,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Rancho Zabaco
US,"The vineyard isn't very far from the Goodin Vineyard, which MacPhail also bottles, but the two wines are very different. This is far riper and more alcoholic, with dense flavors of cherry marmalade and melted chocolate, and a cassis-like liqueur on the finish. It's a glyceriney wine that tastes sweeter than it technically is. Fairly tannic, the wine is best now through 2008.",Pratt Vineyard,92,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"The vineyard is in Sebastopol, in the south of the Russian River Valley. Acidity in this wine is very high, almost prickly, while the fruit tends toward cola, rhubarb, just-ripe cherries, rosehip tea and beef bouillion. It seems like the grapes were picked fairly early to yield a more structured Pinot. Doesn't seem like an ager, but could surprise. The finish is succulent.",Goodin Vineyard,92,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Here's a nice, tasty Pinot that offers plenty of attractive flavor without real complexity. It's light and silky, with spicy cherry, pomegranate, cola, tangerine zest and smoky vanilla flavors. Drink now.",,88,33,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Dark for a blush wine, with a crimson hue, and forward and heavy in flavor, too. Shows red cherries, root beer and spices that are accented with brisk acidity, and finish dry. Not very complex or subtle, but easy with all kinds of summer fare.",Fort Ross Vineyard Rosé,86,14,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"Too sharp in acidity, with an aggressive mouthfeel. Other than that, the cherry and sandalwood flavors are fine, and the wine is dry and silky. But that tartness is a turnoff.",,85,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arissa Jane
US,"Made from grapes grown close to the chilly Pacific, this is a wine with bright acidity and elegance. It's got some size, too, but unlike many big, rich Pinots from warmer areas this one toes the line of balance like a pro. The cherry cola, raspberry, tea and gentle spice flavors are satisfying and complex. Best next year and through 2008.",,91,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"With briary, brambly flavors of wild cherries, blueberries and peppery spices, this is a rugged wine. Its tannins are a bit harsh. Could age, but right now, it's not showing much sophistication.",Fort Ross Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinotage,Fort Ross
US,"This is Marimar's first Sonoma Coast Pinot, and the result is promising. The wine is more acidic and deeper than her estate Pinots, bringing to mind Hirsch Pinots. It's big, rich, complex and almost Syrah-like. A wine to watch.",Dona Margarita Vineyard,90,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
US,"This is a prototypical Pinot from the most famous neighborhood of the Coast appellation. It's a big, full-bodied, heavy wine that's compelling for its dramatic dark fruit. Almost Syrah-like in weight, it defines an emerging style. Not an elegant Pinot Noir but it may be mid-term ageable.",Fort Ross Vineyard High Slopes,89,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Scherrer
US,"Doesn't smell or taste quite ripe and clean. There are vegetal notes, with just enough cherry and oak flavors to earn a passing grade.",Riviera,83,19,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Too acidic for comfort, with a harsh bite that's almost vinegary. Too bad, because the underlying cherry and cola flavors are just fine.",Numbers,83,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Adrian Fog
US,"This is among the lightest in color of Williams Selyem's ‘05 Pinots, and also the most delicate in texture. But yields were very low, and the wine has a fantastically concentrated taste of wild raspberries, as well as crisp, stimulating acidity. Despite the elegance, it's enormously complex, with tiers of oak-influenced cola, herb tea, pomegranate, vanilla and Asian spice flavors. Gorgeous now, this very great Pinot should develop well in the bottle over the next decade.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,97,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"As usual with a Hirsch Pinot, the wine is young and thick and jammy, even a little heavy, and needs time to develop. The wild raspberry, sour cherry, cola and Asian spices have a touch of smoky new oak, while the tannins and acids are noticeable, providing a dry architecture for the ripe fruit. Should develop over the next decade, as everything comes together into balance.",Hirsch Vineyard,93,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Some ageable Pinots are drinkable on release, but not this one. You could decant it for hours, but it's still going to be a fairly tough, tight wine in its youth. Fresh in primary fruit flavors, such as black raspberries, cherries and red plums, it has overtones of coffee, cola, rosehip tea and pomegranates. Best 2009–2015.",Peay Vineyard,92,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Vibrant acidity marks this wine, making the wild cherry, raspberry, cola and tangerine zest flavors racy and fresh. Texture-wise, it's a silky, elegant Pinot that shows great varietal and Sonoma Coast character. But it's too young right now. Should easily negotiate the next 10 or 12 years.",Coastlands Vineyard,91,69,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"I haven't cared for this winery's Bordeaux wines, but with the Burgundians they're hitting pay dirt. This Dijon-clone Pinot is an excellent dry, silky wine with complex flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola, licorice candy and cinnamon spice. Unfiltered and well oaked, the wine offers something new and interesting with every sniff and sip.",Dunah Vineyard,92,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peters Family
US,"Keller enters the big leagues with this marvelously layered Pinot Noir. For starters, it's delicious. Dry and crisp, the flavors are of ripe cherries, raspberries, tangerines, pomegranates and cola, with smoky, spicy complexities from new French oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, leading to a long, fruity finish. Best now and through 2010.",La Cruz Vineyard,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a wind tunnel you'll be hearing more about as the source of cool-climate wines. This lusty Syrah is enormously fruit-forward in cherries, blackberries, coffee, beef carpaccio and peppery spice flavors, an exuberant wine balanced with crisp acids. Drink now through 2009.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"The Freestone area is one of the coolest regions in the sprawling Sonoma Coast. Acidity marks this bone-dry, elegant wine. It tastes like somebody gave a squirt of lime to the cherry, raspberry, cola, persimmon, pomegranate and sandalwood flavors. Seems like a natural for the cellar. Drink 2012–2016.",Freestone Hills,94,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Acidic and gritty. Despite some good raspberry-cherry flavors and sweet oak, this Pinot is hard to like, lacking richness and opulence. Drink now.",Grand Detour,84,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"With briary, brambly flavors of wild cherries, blueberries and peppery spices, this is a rugged wine. Its tannins are a bit harsh. Could age, but right now, it's not showing much sophistication.",Fort Ross Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinotage,Fort Ross
US,"A fairly one-dimensional Pinot Noir. It's soft and drinkable now, with raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Casa de la Cruz
US,"A very beautiful Syrah, long and deep in flavor. It's a big, mouth filling wine whose tannins are considerable, and it will probably benefit from a year or two in the cellar. But it's so rich in blackberries, black currants and smoked meat that it's hard not to open it now. As sweet as the fruit is, the finish is thoroughly dry.",Mavericks Signature Series Rodgers Creek Vineyards,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
US,"There are some unripe, vegetal flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and simple, although it does boast some cherry and currant flavors, and has a nice, silky texture. Ready now.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Simple Math Cellars
US,"Very ripe and deliciously forward in cherries, cola, bacon, anise and sweet smoky sandalwood, with silky tannins. The acidity is a bit low, giving the wine a softness that limits ageability. Now–2011.",,88,44,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"There's a harshness in the mouth to this otherwise likable Pinot Noir. It has the dry astringency of shriveled berry skins, which mar the cherry and cola flavors. Ready now.",,83,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fortunati
US,"A beautiful young Chardonnay, brisk in acidity, and ultra-clean despite the richness. Shows exotic tropical fruit, white peach and sweet vanilla flavors, with a fine minerality that grounds and complexes the fruit. Really easy for everybody to like, although connoisseurs will find all kinds of nuances.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,92,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Follette
US,"Shows the crisp acidity of the coast, with the hedonistic ripeness of the vintage, to produce a pleasantly rich wine to drink now. Floods the mouth with raspberry, cherry, bacon, cola, pepper spice and sandalwood flavors.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
US,"Shows some notes of mold or vegetables, marring an otherwise fine wine. It's pale in color, dry and crisp in acidity, with a beautifully silky texture and flavors of cola and cherries.",Umino Vineyard,83,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"Acidic to the point of sour, with a Lifesaver candy raspberry flavor. At least it's dry.",,82,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Copeland Creek
US,"Dazzles with richness, offering waves of candied, tart raspberry and cherry fruit, Dr. Pepper, exotic Indian spice, rose petal and sandalwood flavors, as well as undefinable feral things. Absolutely dry and high in acidity, with overwhelming complexity, it's a milestone. Drink now through 2014; could go way beyond.",Hirsch Vineyard,97,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Harsh and dry in tannins and acids, with weedy flavors of cherries, herbs and mint. Has a nice, silky texture, but not going anywhere.",,84,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"A big, strongly flavored Pinot Noir. What it may lack in subtlety, it more than makes up for in sheer power. Practically a food group in itself, with massive waves of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, sweet rhubarb pie and sandalwood, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now–2014.",,91,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benovia
US,"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,95,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
US,"A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It displays the qualities of dryness and yeastiness, with complex flavors of limes, vanilla and a touch of raspberry. The mousse is very fine, while the acidity is extraordinarily clean and brisk. Beautiful now, and should age for many years.",Brut,95,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
US,"Tough, acidic and tight in youth, offering little in the way of richness. So tart, so minerally, so dry. A wine that demands time in the cellar. Should reward the patient after six years or so, to allow things to resolve so the cherry, cranberry and rhubarb flavors can transmogrify. It would not be surprising for this wine to develop bottle nuance for well more than a decade.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,94,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Arch and acidic now, which is this wine's main feature. It cuts across the palate with a bite, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever go away. Otherwise, it's dry, silky and rich in ripe wild cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",,87,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pahlmeyer
US,"A terrific Pinot, and one of the few that absolutely demands cellaring. The tannic structure is enormous, providing a sandpapery dryness to the palate. Yet the flavor explosion is so powerful, you can enjoy it now with utter satisfaction. Erupts in grilled blackberry and cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon, anise, sautéed wild mushroom and smoky sandalwood flavors, leading to a spicy finish that continues for a full minute. Glorious and decadent. The winemaker was Sashi Moorman, from Stolpman, and the vineyard was planted in 1994 to the Calera clone. Only 115 cases were produced. Drink now–2017.",Occidental Vineyard,98,150,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
US,"Gorgeous and immaculate. Showcases Russian River/Sonoma Coast Pinot at its finest, with superb acidity, ultra-refined tannins and flavors of grilled blackberries, cherry pie filling, cola, crushed black pepper, cinnamon, anise and smoky, caramelized sandalwood. As rich as it is, there's an elusive quality, with hints of wild game and undefineable forest floor. Beautiful now and through 2015.",Occidental Coast Two Daughters Vineyard,96,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
US,"A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.",Michaela's Reserve,94,110,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Brogan
US,"Enormously rich and powerful, showing tremendous authority. Oozes ripe, candied raspberry, cherry, sweet cola, licorice, pie spice and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into ripe, fine tannins. Feels really toned, sculpted, with a long, dry, spicy finish. Drink now through 2014.",Split Rock Vineyard,94,43,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Saudade
US,"This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress.",Clos Madeleine,93,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Notre Vin
US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",Estate Grown,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pfendler
US,"A little thin, with bare-bones cherry, cola and oak flavors. Even though the alcohol is low, it shows through with heat. But the texture is silky and the finish is dry. Drink now.",,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani
US,"Shows the exotic power of the vineyard, with wild cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, and the crisp acidity of the far Sonoma Coast. But not one you want to drink now. It's tight, dry, minerally, aloof. Needs time. Definitely a wine to cellar until at least 2014.",Peay Vineyard,93,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay.",Stone Côte Vineyard,96,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"A fine example of a Sonoma Coast Pinot, marked by bright, cleansing acidity and rich, yet modulated, cherry, raspberry, cola, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors. There's a spicy, silky elegance that makes repeated sips rewarding. Now through 2014.",La Brisa,92,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Doesn't smell or taste quite ripe and clean. There are vegetal notes, with just enough cherry and oak flavors to earn a passing grade.",Riviera,83,19,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Too acidic for comfort, with a harsh bite that's almost vinegary. Too bad, because the underlying cherry and cola flavors are just fine.",Numbers,83,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Adrian Fog
US,"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.",,88,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Anaba
US,"High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards. The crispness lends a vibrant tension to the intense flavors of Meyer lemons, orange blossom and minerals, while oak adds softer, spicy notes. Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way.",Seascape Vineyard,94,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
US,"An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after.",,94,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"A blend of various vineyards from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, and also Hartford Court's highest-production Pinot Noir. Always beautiful and balanced, the '07 in particular is remarkable for its silky tannins and overall seamless quality. Really excites for the complexity of currant, cola, licorice and cedar flavors. Now through 2013.",Land's Edge,94,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"From the winery's Annapolis Vineyard, at the cool, northern tip of the “true” Sonoma Coast, comes this chunky young Pinot Noir. Although the grapes were destemmed before fermentation, the tannins are significant, a reflection of the low yields and tough skins the berries develop. In fact, the wine is almost Zinny in its full body and spicy, briary fruit. It clearly needs time. Best after 2011.",Far Coast,93,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
US,"This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast.",,92,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"There's a nice wine in here somewhere, but now it's cloaked under a heavy coating of oak and tannins, and the primary fruit cherry-berry flavors have a pie-filling sweetness. Give it at least 6–12 months in the cellar.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"An impressive Pinot Noir grown from a mix of vineyards in this sprawling coastal appellation. Defines the best characteristics of this fine vintage, a dry, crisp wine, brimming with luscious flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, spices and sweet, smoky new oak. A real crowd pleaser, this Pinot should develop through 2013.",,94,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benovia
US,"A very fine Pinot Noir that shows deep, impressively ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, red currant, licorice and Asian spices, with a rich coating of smoky oak. It's entirely dry, and has a brisk scour of acidity. Seems best now and for the next few years.",,91,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey
US,"With tiers of honeyed apricot, pear, pineapple tart, vanilla and crème brûlée flavors, this is a delicious sweet wine. The residual sugar is more than 13%. Fortunately, all this richness is balanced with crisp coastal acidity.",Late Harvest,92,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Heintz
US,"Soft and direct, this Pinot Noir offers easy flavors of cherries, currants, cola and spice, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Acidity, dryness and steely minerality characterize this Chard. It has lemon and vanilla flavors that are brisk and clean. It's refreshing to get such an elegant alternative to today's ripe, fruity Chards. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink this brilliant wine with shellfish, sourdough bread and lots of butter.",,94,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ovation
US,"Made with Dijon clones from a vineyard in a cool corner of Sebastopol, this rich young Pinot brims with fresh acidity. It has complex flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, rhubarb, sandalwood and pepper, wrapped into a silky texture. Just a delight, and should age over the next six years.",Goodin Vineyard,94,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A fine Pinot Noir that needs some time to come around. Right now, the oak and fruit haven't come together, giving a butterscotch edge to the cherries. But it's dry, moderate in alcohol and crisp, and just needs a few years to develop. 2010–2013.",McDougall Ranch Vineyard,92,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Drew
US,"Smells and tastes a bit unripe, with some green, minty notes. Turns soft in the mouth, with cherry, raspberry and oak flavors. Could use greater complexity and depth.",,84,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Adobe Road
US,"High in acidity, this single-vineyard Pinot stings the palate with tartness. Yet it's packed with rich currant, persimmon and Dr. Pepper flavors, and is dry and moderate in alcohol. Although this winery has little history, the wine may develop bottle elegance. Try after 2009.",Suacci Vineyard,88,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"Fresh and crisp in acidity, but very clean and balanced, this young Pinot wants a year or two in the cellar. It's silky, and elegant and rich in raspberries, cherries, cola, pomegranates and sweet, smoky oak.",Split Rock Vineyard,91,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Petito
US,"The grapes come from a vineyard in a part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast appellation that has yet to prove itself. The wine is ripe, with delicious cherry and raspberry-pie-filling flavors liberally accented with the sweet toast and vanilla notes of oak. There's an obvious appeal of deliciousness, and while it doesn't tire the palate, it doesn't offer extreme complexity. Drink now.",,90,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longfellow
US,"Made in a lighter, silkier, more accessible style, this is an elegant Pinot Noir that suggests lamb, roast salmon and other upscale dishes. It's easy to drink, but also complex, with intricately layered flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants, licorice, sassafras, sweet smoky cedar and Asian spices.",Balletto Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"Just what you want from a Sonoma Coast Chard. It's bone dry, crisp in cool-climate acidity, and elegant, with a minerally tang to the Meyer lemon fruit. Oak barrels bring richer notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Beautiful, and should hold through 2012.",,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Shows its cool-climate origins in the crisp acidity and powerful black pepper aromas and flavors that mark this very fine Syrah. The other flavors range from blackberries, violets and sandalwood to a distinctly meaty note. Beautiful now with your most upscale food.",Estate Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Baker Lane
US,"Dark as midnight on a moonless night,with an impenetrable, mysterious aroma, this wine is nowhere near ready to drink, but it shows considerable promise. Teases with flavors of blackberry tart, black currants, mocha and sweet violets, and chocaholics will appreciate the dark, slightly sweet chocolate notes. Dramatic and complex, this Syrah should develop through the next six years, at least.",,93,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"The winery's approach is to let the Pinot Gris fruit shine through. They put a tiny amount of oak on it, but it's primarily stainless steel fermented. Tastes fresh and crisp and appley, with notes of peaches and citrus fruits that finish thoroughly dry.",,87,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,MacMurray Ranch
US,"Shows the integrity of previous bottlings, but without the concentration or Northern Rhône-like quality of the last several vintages. The hot '04 harvest has made the wine simpler. Gone is the pepper and meat, replaced by fruit jam and chocolate. Drink this tasty, elegant wine now.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,87,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,MacRostie
US,"Beautiful and lush, with wonderfully rich flavors of cherry pie filling, licorice, rosehip tea, sandalwood and cola, with a dash of cinnamon, pepper and vanilla powder. Gorgeous now, and will develop for at least four years.",,92,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Here's a Pinot that's so beautiful and beguiling, it's perfect to drink right away. Feels delicate and silky, with lush flavors of cherries, cotton candy, bacon, sassafras, orange peel and dusty Asian spices.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"A blend of two Sebastopol vineyards, this Pinot shows the fine qualities of the vintage. It's bone dry and quite crisp, with complex flavors of red cherries, red licorice, cola and spicy new French oak. Really elegant. Drink now through 2011.",,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Ripeness of fruit and tart acidity combine to make this a fine, drily elegant coastal Chardonnay. Beyond the great structure are savory flavors of pineapples and green apples, with rich notes of honeysuckle flower and a grounding tug of minerality.",,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ovation
US,"Tough and gritty now, with dominating acids that give the wine a hard mouthfeel. Yet there's some impressive red currant, tangerine, ruby grapefruit and cola fruit in there. Will it develop polish and softness? Hard to tell. Decant if you drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
US,"Tremendously fruity, offering an orchard-burst of delicious cherry, red plum, raspberry pie filling, cinnamon toast, anise and cola flavors. Shows the silky texture and racy acidity of a fine coastal Pinot Noir.",,92,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"A lovely Pinot marked by crispness, complexity of fruit, and the hard-to-describe wild, feral attractions of the Sonoma Coast. With brisk tannins, the wine shows cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors, with an ineffable expression of wild thyme, sage and lavender. Drink this beautiful wine now and through 2014.",,92,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Heintz
US,"A harsh, nasty Pinot Noir. It's just barely recommendable for the cherries and silky texture.",,80,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Adler Fels
US,"Ripe and delicious right out of the bottle, although it will age well. Made from a vineyard on the true Sonoma Coast, in the remote Fort Ross area, it's fabulously rich in cherry, framboise and red currant flavors, with intriguing waves of anise, bacon and sweet, vanilla-scented smoky sandalwood. There's a foresty taste, too, suggesting dried pine needles. The tannins and acids are near perfect. Stunning now, and should hold for at least six years.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,98,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"A brilliant wine. Racy in acidity, silky in texture, yet powerful, it exudes the essence of Pinot Noir's greatness. Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel. Absolutely dry, with a firm spine of tannins, the structure is near perfect. A divine expression of Hirsch, and a good candidate for six years in the cellar.",Hirsch Vineyard,97,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The grapes from this vineyard in the Petaluma Gap typically get very ripe, while maintaining the acidity needed for balance. Tandem's ‘05 is richly elegant and riper than in the past, with opulent flavors of nectarines, candied peaches and pears, marzipan, honeysuckle, butterscotch and cinnamon. Should stay at its peak for several years.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,92,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"Made in a lighter style, both color-wise and texturally. Shows polished cherry pulp and cherryskin flavors, with orange zest, cola and anise adding complexity. Drink this drily elegant wine now.",,86,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Cellars
US,"Here's a pretty, polished Pinot for drinking now with a nice steak. It's dry and silky, with good varietal flavors of cherries, cola, rhubarb, grilled mushrooms and smoky oak, finished with dusty spices. There's even a touch of barnyard.",Bella Luna Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"Here's a young, dry, acidic Pinot Noir that clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has a beautifully silky texture, and is made in a light, elegant style, with very complex flavors. Waves of sour red cherry candy and cola flavors wash over the palate, accented with orange zest, cinnamon, Asian spices, anise and sandalwood. Better after 2011 and should develop for 3–5 years after that.",Hellenthal Vineyard,94,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"A massive Chardonnay, rich in fruit and oak. Shows long, decadent flavors of roasted pineapples, nectarines, honeysuckle, vanilla, buttered toast and meringue, dusted with cinnamon spice and brown sugar. Structure is fortunately provided by crisp acidity and even a framework of wood tannins. Now–2013.",,94,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pahlmeyer
US,"Oak dominates this wine. The idea seems to have been Chablis, to judge by the dryness and citrusy minerality. But the char and toast are very strong and the underlying richness isn't there for balance.",,86,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ernest & Julio Gallo
US,"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,86,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peters Family
US,"Here's a big, rich, extracted young Pinot Noir, almost Grenache-like in its full-bodied cherriness. Other interesting flavors include cola, sandalwood and peppery spices. Very dry, and wants some time in the bottle to soften and mellow. Best between 2011–2015.",Raymondo Vineyard,90,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Baker Lane
US,"A wonderfully drinkable Chardonnay that shows brilliant coastal character and lots of richness, at a decent price. Crisp and dry, it has elaborate flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice.",,90,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
US,"A good, complex Pinot Noir that shows the dramatic structure of the far Sonoma Coast. It's rich in acidity and tannins, yet still is silky and gentle in the mouth. The cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors are delicious. Very fine now and for a few more years.",,90,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Give this beauty 3-4 years in the cellar, and if you can't, at least decant it for hours before serving. It's a beautiful young Pinot Noir, very dry and as silky as satin in the mouth, showing ripe, oak-inspired flavors of cherries, raspberries, cocoa, cola and spices. Shows the elegant acidity and structure of this wonderful vintage on the Sonoma Coast.",Balletto Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"Chardonnay doesn't get much richer or riper than this. Explodes with grilled pineapple, lemondrop, smoky meringue, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened and boosted by crisp, citrusy cool-climate acidity. Racy and clean and complex, it should develop bottle nuance over the next four years.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bjornstad
US,"Lots of delicious, savory currant, licorice and mocha flavors in this dry Pinot that will go so well with a grilled steak. It's a bit soft and heavy, but enjoyable nonetheless.",Durell Vineyard,87,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Loring Wine Company
US,"Dark, full-bodied and extracted, this young Pinot Noir is a big wine. It explodes in jammy black cherries, red currants, licorice, cola, bacon and smoke, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Dry and moderately ageable. Drink now through 2012.",La Brisa,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"A really good Chardonnay that shows the classic acidity and dryness of the Sonoma Coast, with complex, pleasurable flavors. Pineapples, pears, apricots and guavas are the fruits, enriched with sweet oak, in a dry, balanced and elegant wine that could develop bottle nuance over the next 2–4 years.",,90,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
US,"Dry, silky and complex, this Pinot is as good as WesMar's more costly single-vineyard Pinots, which makes it a great value. It shows great structural integrity, with crisp acids and fine tannins that house exotic flavors of cherry compote, Dr. Pepper cola, orange zest, Canadian bacon and Asian spices. Now–2013.",,93,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"This is one of the darkest of Williams Selyem's new Pinots and also one of the ripest. It's jammy in the intensity of raspberry and cherry fruit, with a savory, Dr. Pepper cola richness. The spiciness, which is one of winemaker Bob Cabral's specialties in capturing, is exotic. It's a big, fat, rich wine that needs decanting now, and should age for 4–6 years.",Coastlands Vineyard,93,69,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"You might think of a Sonoma Coast Pinot as one marked by high, cool-climate acidity, but this is quite a soft wine. It's also a luscious one, marked by fruit flavors of cherries, currants, raspberries, pomegranates, persimmons and cola. The vineyard is in the eastern part of this sprawling appellation.",La Cruz Vineyard,90,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"This is a blend of several vineyards from throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast region. It shows crisp, upfront acidity that makes the wine tart, and lasts through the dry finish. Flavor-wise, it's all about pears, enriched with toasty oak.",Golden Coast,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins. Drink now, for fresh, jammy fruitiness.",Griffin's Lair,89,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Ultrarich in cherry, black raspberry and red currant flavors, with a savory note of grilled beef and the sweet, salty umami of bacon. New oak brings vanilla bean and caramel richness. The result is a strongly flavored wine, but it's balanced with fine acidity. Drink now.",Sangiacomo Old Lakeville Road Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Campesino
US,"Good structure, with a silky mouthfeel, crisp coastal acidity and firm tannins. You'll also find ripe cherry, currant, mocha and pepper spice flavors. Yet there's a disarming tartness that detracts, and limits ageability.",,86,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lionheart
US,"Sweet in oak and simple, with jammy apricot, pineapple and gingerbread flavors.",,84,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
US,"A well-made, delicious Pinot Noir. While it's a bit heavy for this variety, almost like a Grenache, there's no denying the wealth of cherry, licorice, bacon and cola flavor. Should hold well in the bottle over 3–5 years.",The Racing Line,89,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,The Line
US,"Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak. Other than that, it's a bit soft and one-dimensional, but the score reflects how delicious it is.",,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clouds Rest
US,"Delicious flavors of cola, cherries, raspberries, rose tea, orange peel, vanilla and smoky sandalwood merge in this single-vineyard Pinot Noir, and it's nicely dry, with a silky-smooth texture. Give it a good decant before serving, as it gets better as it breathes.",Sonoma Stage Vineyard,90,47,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peters Family
US,"Succulent and crisp; those two words are what you want in a California Pinot Gris, and you get them here. The pear, pineapple, peach and fig flavors are balanced with refreshing acidity, while a touch of oak and sur lie aging adds accents of smoke and creamy vanilla.",,90,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,MacMurray Ranch
US,"This is a dark, big wine, almost like a Syrah, and lacking in the subtlety and silky texture you want in a Pinot Noir. Its flavors are of blackberries, currants and cedar, and it's pretty tannic. But it could develop interestingly over the next 6–8 years.",Griffin's Lair,89,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Much different from last year's bottling, and better, but also more expensive. It's a big, rich, Rhônish Pinot that requires some age to calm down. Shows tannic flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola, anise, sassafras and sandalwood.",Hurst Vineyard,89,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Baker Lane
US,"Very light in color and silky in body, but rich and elegant in flavor, this is a fine Pinot. It shows dry flavors of cherries, cola, sassafras, cedar, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Drink now.",,89,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
US,"The most full-bodied of Sojourn's new Pinot Noirs, a rich, thick wine of Grenache-like proportions. Although it's delicious now in cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and sandalwood, it's a bit heavy and tannic. Could emerge like a butterfly from this cocoon sometime after mid-2010.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,89,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"Although this is from the Sonoma Coast appellation, it's high elevation, so the vineyard is often above the fog that plagues the lower Russian River Valley. As a result, the wine is quite ripe and forward in jammy raspberries, cherries, licorice and cola. New French oak adds the usual smoky, vanilla accents.",Clone 828,89,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
US,"Silky and dry, but a bit harsh and raw around the edges, with some green, unripe flavors of mint accompanying the cherries and oak. Not likely to improve, so drink now, after a good decanting.",Leepin Vineyard,85,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
US,"A classy Pinot Noir that shows the attributes of its vintage and origin. The grapes come from the cooler, southern part of Russian River Valley, and the wine displays brisk acidity and complex flavors of cherries, pomegranates and cola. It's young now, but dry and elegant, and should develop bottle complexity through 2013.",,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Chronicle
US,"Released, for some reason, at the age of four-plus years, this Syrah is losing fruit and showing its age. It's dry and tannic and showing some vegetal, herbal bones, but with enough of a blackberry and cherry coat to get by. Not going anywhere.",,88,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
US,"A very good Pinot for drinking now. With a silky-smooth mouthfeel, it has rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, anise, cinnamon and sweet smoky oak. Delicious and savory.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,88,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vergari
US,"A beautiful Syrah, dry and velvety, with a delicious array of flavors. Red and black cherries, beef jerky, anise and loads of crushed black pepper have a touch of smoky oak. Drink now with, what else, pepper steak.",Sonoma Coast Cuvée,88,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Baker Lane
US,"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. It's delicious and crisply elegant, with a silky texture, but a little direct and forward. Probably at its best now.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,88,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it.",Estate,95,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"Shows the coolness of the vintage with a tartly acidic mouthfeel that gives the cherry and raspberry flavors a sour candy feel. Other flavors include mint and a pleasantly sweet touch of butterscotch from oak. Other than the sharpness, this is a pretty nice Pinot.",Gap's Crown,87,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"Heavy and a bit hot in alcohol, and badly needs greater structural integrity in the way of crispness and lightness. The flavors are ultra-ripe, of blackberry and cherry pie filling and Dr. Pepper.",Kanzler Vineyard,85,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,A.P. Vin
US,"Rigidity and acidity mark this young Pinot Noir. It's tart and a little tannic, but it has enormously rich flavors of cherries, currants, cola and pomegranates, enriched with smoky, spicy oak. Fine now with decanting and pairing with very rich fare, but should reward a few years in the cellar.",Pearlessence,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"A good Pinot that shows a fine coastal influence. Dry and silky, it displays flavors of ripe cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice and sandalwood, with a cinnamon and pepper flourish. Drink now.",,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
US,"Tin Barn has a pretty good record at making a Northern Rhône-style Syrah. This wine has deliciously dry, peppery flavors of ripe blackberries, currants and minerals. But what it could use is better structure, especially acidity.",Coryelle Fields Vineyard,86,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Tin Barn
US,"Good and rich, but a bit ungainly. Sharpness makes it tart, and the oak stands out, shoving the cherry, currant, plum and cola flavors aside. These may be the marks of an immature wine, but it is very difficult to forecast this Pinot's future. On the assumption that balance now equals balance later, it's probably not an ager.",,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes. Yet the oak is heavy-handed, overwhelming the fruit with caramel, and making the finish too sweet.",,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Heintz
US,"Notable for sheer deliciousness, the way you can't stop at one sip but want more. Soft and gentle, with just a touch of crispness and oak tannins, this Pinot's flavors star. Raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, cola, vanilla all mingle into some fabulously sweet confection that manages to finish thoroughly dry.",Armagh Vineyard,92,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,86,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
US,"Dry on the finish, but lush in smoky oak and pineapple meringue and custard flavors, this is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay to drink now.",,87,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
US,"Soft and sensual, this Pinot is a real charmer. With a texture as plush as velvet, it offers a tapestry of cherry, black raspberry, currant, chocolate, orange zest and anise flavors that go on and on. Best now for its sheer lusciousness.",,91,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"A dry, polished Pinot, zesty in crisp coastal acidity, with a light texture framing flavors of red cherries, cola, rhubarb and pepper. Drink now.",,87,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
US,"Very good, but could be firmer in tannic structure, with a soft, melted mouthfeel. Yet the flavors are delicious, of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, orange tea, herbs, cinnamon spice and smoky sandalwood. The softness seems to limit ageability.",Peters Vineyard,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
US,"Veteran winery Taft Street has crafted a gentle, easy-drinking Pinot from the cool Sonoma Coast appellation. The wine is pale in color, dry and crisp, with a silky texture, and has nice varietal flavors of cola, cherries and smoke.",,86,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Taft Street
US,"Sharp in acidity and bone dry, this is a good, everyday Pinot Noir. It shows a properly silky texture, and flavors of cola, cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now.",,86,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
US,"A tough, rugged, tannic young wine, brisk in acids and pepper, and not showing much opulence now. There's a molten core of blackberries and grilled, meaty leather, leading to a bone dry finish. Should mellow with 1–2 years in the bottle.",De Luxe,87,27,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek
US,"Testarossa's 2007 Chardonnays are out, and this La Cruz is right up there with the best of them. Rich in citrusy acids, it dazzles the palate with Mandarin orange, pineapple-infused crème brûlée, mineral, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Drink this decadent wine soon.",La Cruz Vineyard,95,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
US,"A little on the sweet and soft side, with Dr. Pepper and cherry-black raspberry cream flavors, enriched with vanilla, and finished with caramelized oak. This silky-textured wine is to open now.",,85,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MooBuzz
US,"A tough, leathery wine, very dry and pretty tannic, with pleasant berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. It's mainly Syrah, with 14% Cabernet Franc, and shows mouthwateringly crisp acidity.",,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Red Blend,Rumpus
US,"Soft and a bit heavy, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, anise, cedar and mocha. Delicious in the sheer voluptuousness of these tastes, but could use firmer structure.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
US,"The Jackson and Hartford families established this vineyard on the far Sonoma Coast in hopes of crafting Pinot Noir at the limits of its ability to ripen. The magnificent 2007 vintage has resulted in a wine of unusual tension. It's very ripe in black and red cherry pie filling and sweet oak flavors, but retains the acidity of its cool-climate origins, and even offers a feral taste of bloody meat. Drink this impressive, complex wine now and through 2015.",Seascape,95,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
US,"Acidity makes the mouth water, tannins provide a firm framework, oak is perfectly integrated, and the depth of fruit is impressive. Shows flavors of cherry tart, raspberry Newton, cola, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla that are magnificent and decadent. Elegant and classy. Should negotiate the years through 2014.",Ellenbach Vineyard,95,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Semper
US,"This is among the lightest in color of Williams Selyem's ‘05 Pinots, and also the most delicate in texture. But yields were very low, and the wine has a fantastically concentrated taste of wild raspberries, as well as crisp, stimulating acidity. Despite the elegance, it's enormously complex, with tiers of oak-influenced cola, herb tea, pomegranate, vanilla and Asian spice flavors. Gorgeous now, this very great Pinot should develop well in the bottle over the next decade.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,97,85,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"As usual with a Hirsch Pinot, the wine is young and thick and jammy, even a little heavy, and needs time to develop. The wild raspberry, sour cherry, cola and Asian spices have a touch of smoky new oak, while the tannins and acids are noticeable, providing a dry architecture for the ripe fruit. Should develop over the next decade, as everything comes together into balance.",Hirsch Vineyard,93,72,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Some ageable Pinots are drinkable on release, but not this one. You could decant it for hours, but it's still going to be a fairly tough, tight wine in its youth. Fresh in primary fruit flavors, such as black raspberries, cherries and red plums, it has overtones of coffee, cola, rosehip tea and pomegranates. Best 2009–2015.",Peay Vineyard,92,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"An awkward wine, tough and gritty in tannins, with green, mint tea flavors alongside the cherries and cola. Good, but lacks charm and richness. Drink now.",Reserve,85,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
US,"Vibrant acidity marks this wine, making the wild cherry, raspberry, cola and tangerine zest flavors racy and fresh. Texture-wise, it's a silky, elegant Pinot that shows great varietal and Sonoma Coast character. But it's too young right now. Should easily negotiate the next 10 or 12 years.",Coastlands Vineyard,91,69,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The most successful of Amphora's new Pinots because of its richness and balance. Shows strong, forward flavors of berries, cherries and cola, liberally accented with sandalwood, and brightened with acidity. Yet there are elusive tugs of earthier, mushroomy notes. Delicious now, and probably at its best through 2011.",,90,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Amphora
US,"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
US,"A spectacular Chardonnay grown in Failla's estate vineyard, high in the mountains above the Sonoma Coast, and open to the Pacific's cool winds. The pineapple custard, tangerine, lemon tart and mineral flavors are compellingly delicious, while crisp coastal acidity adds a refreshingly clean tang. This is a grand cru wine.",,95,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
US,"This is always a tight, dry, tannic Pinot Noir due to its cool, low-yielding vineyard. The '06 is a very fine example. It's astringent and closed, but with a luscious heart of black cherries, red currants and Dr. Pepper cola. With decanting, it's fine now with something rich, like wild mushroom risotto, and should develop through 2012.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
US,"Made in a very oaky, Sonoma Coast style that emphasizes enormously ripe fruit and crisp acids. The green apple, pineapple tart and pear flavors are enriched with vanilla, buttered toast and butterscotch Lifesaver sour candy. Flamboyant and dramatic, but not an ager, so drink young.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,89,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"This is from a cool, southeastern corner of the large Sonoma Coast AVA. In this cool vintage, you can taste the fog in the crisp acids and dense tannins. Not a fruit bomb like so many others. Instead, a very dry, serious Syrah that requires patience. Such is the action-packed core of blackberries and currants that this wine should evolve over the next decade.",,92,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Lynmar
US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",Estate,97,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014.",Pearlessence,95,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Delicious and appealing, a palate-flattering wine that offers a gorgeous structure. Waves of black cherries, raspberries, cola, sweet rhubarb pie, persimmon and pomegranate flood the palate, and then a crisp gate of acidity slams down on the finish, although the spices get through and linger long. Best now for sheer exuberance.",Liberty Bridge Split Rock Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
US,"With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour. Seems like it should mellow over the next 3–4 years, although not much beyond that.",Kanzler Vineyard,92,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"Right off the bat you can taste the acidity in this wine, which is brighter and crisper than, say, the winery's Russian River Pinot. The tartness lifts the black cherry, cherry and raspberry flavors, heightening their impact through the long, spicy finish. Still, it's a wine for early drinking.",,90,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Marked by crisp, coastal acidity, this Pinot has a lightly silky texture, but the flavors are quite concentrated. Shows strawberry jam, red cherry tart and dusty spice flavors, an elegant wine of clarity and distinction. Not really an ager, but will hold for a good six years.",Peay Vineyard,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"Feels a little brittle, with lots of acidity giving a sharp edge to the cherries, currants, cola and sandalwood. The guess is whether the wine will mellow with time in the bottle, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Drink now, with rich fare for balance.",Armagh Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Savannah-Chanelle
US,"The grapes are from the newish region just west of Petaluma, a chilly, windy area. The climate shows in the brisk acidity, while the excellence of the vintage gives savory flavors of cherries, anise and cola. Oak adds a fine touch of toast. Drink now–2013.",,90,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Morris Ranch
US,"Fancy, with racy acidity and rich oak framing ripe natural flavors of pineapple brûlée, pear concentrate and Meyer lemon essence. Rich, but balanced and elegant.",Oro de Plata,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller
US,"Located on the southern edge of the appellation, practically within sight of the office towers of San Francisco, this wine has very ripe fruit. The baked cherry pie filling flavor is a little one-dimensional, but it's a delicious dimension. Finishes nicely dry and spicy.",,87,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Longfellow
US,"A nice, crisp and bone-dry Pinot that shows plenty of elegant class. Satisfies for its silky texture and flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange zest, cola and mint. Drink now.",,89,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
US,"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy.",Fort Ross Vineyard,95,37,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross
US,"Shows good varietal character, with cola, cherry and pomegranate flavors grounded with earthier notes of rhubarb and tobacco. Feels a bit soft in structure, lacking liveliness, so drink up now.",Lakeville Vineyard,86,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Amphora
US,"Shows amazingly ripe fruit, offering a blast of pineapple jam, apricot, tangerine, papaya and lime flavors. The acidity is crisp and tart, and the oak is rich and flamboyant, yet in keeping with the size of the underling wine. Super-rich and decadent, this Chardonnay is at its best soon.",Fort Ross Vineyard,93,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
US,"Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific. Dry and elegant, it shows massively concentrated cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich coating of smoky sandalwood. Wonderful now, but the youthful power suggests time in the cellar through 2015 or so.",MK Vineyard,93,65,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Small Vines
US,"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",Charm Acres,93,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pali
US,"High in acids and dry, this wine has a sharp bite. It's big in blackberry jam and cherry jelly flavors, with a smooth, velvety texture and a rustic finish.",Cool Climate,84,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Cline
US,"You can taste the racy acidity and minerality of the cool Sonoma Coast in this silky, bone-dry Pinot. The cola, cherry, raspberry and spice flavors are pretty and polished. This is a good price for a coastal Pinot of this elegance.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani
US,"After years of buying grapes, Merry Edwards finally has her own vineyard in the Sonoma Coast. This young wine is high in acidity that offsets the ripe red and black cherry, mocha, cola and cinnamon spice flavors. It's elegant and complex now, and changes as it warms and breathes in the glass. There's a sugary sweetness on the finish.",Meredith Estate,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"Released unusually at the age of nearly five years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit. It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake. Meanwhile the sweet, caramelized oak is fully integrated. Bravo to the winery for holding this back and letting us see what an older Sonoma Coast Chardonay does.",Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
US,"Keller enters the big leagues with this marvelously layered Pinot Noir. For starters, it's delicious. Dry and crisp, the flavors are of ripe cherries, raspberries, tangerines, pomegranates and cola, with smoky, spicy complexities from new French oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, leading to a long, fruity finish. Best now and through 2010.",La Cruz Vineyard,91,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
US,"Too green and acidic for pleasure, with mint dominating the rather modest cherries and red currants. Sleek and elegant in the mouth, but the absence of richness hurts the score.",Rodgers Creek,84,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Picket Fence
US,"After missing a beat in '04, the '05 reverts to the high quality of the '03. Made from Dijon clones, the wine shows a brilliant purity of cherry fruit, with rich, earthy complexities of mushrooms, forest floor, cola and balsam. Bone dry, it has an elegantly silky quality that cries out for the best foods. Best now and for the next four years.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,52,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
US,"Shows tart cranberry crispness in addition to richer cherry and raspberry fruit, but it's a fairly aloof wine now, with competing parts. Even though this isn't a single-vineyard Pinot, it needs time in the cellar, to let everything mellow. Give it 4–5 years.",,90,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a wind tunnel you'll be hearing more about as the source of cool-climate wines. This lusty Syrah is enormously fruit-forward in cherries, blackberries, coffee, beef carpaccio and peppery spice flavors, an exuberant wine balanced with crisp acids. Drink now through 2009.",La Cruz Vineyard,89,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Keller Estate
US,"This is a hugely flavored, extracted Pinot Noir, distinctly Californian in its ripeness and size. It's massive in cherries and raspberries, with hints of cocoa, anise, Indian spices and black pepper. With 60% new French oak, it's also pretty toasty. A bit ungainly now, but should gain in the cellar. Better after 2013.",Freestone Hills,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"There's a wildland, coastal mountain taste to this wine, which brims with bone-dry, exotic, woodsy tastes of wild forest cherries, fennel, balsam, cola, volcanic minerals, raw beef and Asian spices, not to mention the sweet veneer of sandalwood. It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",Hellenthal Vineyard,96,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad
US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",Pastorale Vineyard,95,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"This big, young Pinot should have been held back before release, because it's really tannic and primary now, making its future hard to evaluate. However, it seems a likely cellar candidate. It's fresh in acids and clearly has a pedigree of terroir, showing mineral-infused raspberries, cherries, rhubarbs, wild strawberries, and pomegranates, accented with rich, smoky oak. The texture is pure silk, and the finish is firmly dry. Give it until 2012, at the very least.",Bill and Joan's Special Selection,94,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness. There are dozens of Pinot Noirs that are more drinkable now, but this is such an interesting interpretation that it deserves a place in your cellar. Try after 2013.",Pastorale Vineyard,94,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"Lots of acidity in this very dry, somewhat austere young Pinot Noir. That sharp bite is relieved by fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola, not to mention sweet oak. Give it a good decant, but it's always going to be tart.",Split Rock Vineyard,87,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Trout Street
US,"Shows the dryness and crispness you want in a fine coastal Pinot Noir, with good flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranate juice and sandalwood. Feels a bit ragged in the mouth, with some sharpness, and probably won't age, so drink now.",,87,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,M. Autumn
US,"Showcases the terroir and potential of this extreme appellation, but if you're a fan of rich, opulently fruity Pinots, go elsewhere. This is a minimalist wine, dry and acidic, with a firm minerality undergirding cherry and cola flavors. Burgundy-oriented Pinotphiles will appreciate the complexity.",,91,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"Quite a good Chardonnay, made from Freestone's vineyards in the chilly southwestern part of the appellation, where coastal winds sweep in. Acidity and minerality give structure to the pineapple, honeysuckle, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors. Drink this elegant wine now with upscale fare.",,93,75,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
US,"Made from grapes grown close to the chilly Pacific, this is a wine with bright acidity and elegance. It's got some size, too, but unlike many big, rich Pinots from warmer areas this one toes the line of balance like a pro. The cherry cola, raspberry, tea and gentle spice flavors are satisfying and complex. Best next year and through 2008.",,91,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast Vineyards
US,"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purée, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crème brûlée, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals. Exotic and delicious, it's at its best now.",Split Rock Vineyard,92,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bartz-Allen
US,"It's unusual to see a Pinot Gris from this appellation, much less a vineyard-designated one. This wine easily lives up to its address. It's sleek, slick and clean in high acidity, with a vibrant minerality that explodes with fig, grapefruit and white pepper flavors. Absolutely yummy.",Balletto Vineyards Unwooded,90,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Mayo
US,"Shows lots of the flavors and supple texture you expect from a coastal Pinot Noir. Dry and silky, it offers a range of cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, vanilla, cinnamon-pepper and sandalwood flavors. Turns a bit harsh toward the finish, but a good value.",Barrel Reserve,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Toasted Head
US,"Although it's forward in cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, it's a balanced, polished wine, with nice coastal acidity and a touch of tannins. Drink now.",Director's Cut,87,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"Tastes like cherry-pie filling that got a little caramelized in the oven, giving it a Rhône-type note. Maybe charred oak contributes to the smoky heaviness. Either way, it's a distraction from the delicate, sensual silkiness we all want from Pinot Noir.",Pratt Vineyard,87,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Deliciously soft and flavorful now, with all sorts of ripe primary fruit and new oak influences that are almost candied in their richness. Raspberries, cherries, orange zest, licorice, bacon, cinnamon, vanilla and sweet smoky sandalwood flood the mouth, firmed up with fine tannins. Best now–2012.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,90,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Not particularly pleasurable at this point. The numbing tannins and high acids completely obscure everything that's going on below, which leaves collectors the option of cellaring it. I do not know where this wine is going, but my money's on ageability, because it's so rich in fruit. Try again in 2010.",Stage Gulch Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
US,"There's a bubble-gummy, almost Beaujolais quality to this Pinot, which spent 15 months in 3/4 new French oak. It's rude now, with oaky, grapey flavors of black raspberry marmalade and Dr. Pepper cola. While it's dry and crisp and interesting, it's awkward. Is it an ager? Here's where crystal balls are required. Try between 2011–2013.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,90,100,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
US,"Tastes a bit tired, with apricot and pineapple flavors that are losing their fruity flesh, showing herbal bones. Dry and crisp, it's unlikely to improve with further age.",Les Pierres,84,41,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Cutrer
US,"What this wine needs is more acidic crispness. The flavors are totally delicious, the texture is elegant, the finish is totally dry, but the superripe cherries, raspberries, cocoa and cola just sort of melt into the palate, then fade away.",Irene's Vineyard,86,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
US,"Dry and crisp, but a little heavy in fruity extract. Shows direct flavors of apricots and orange meringue pie filling.",Marsanne,84,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Roussanne,Cline
US,"Very ripe, in the manner of this spectacular vintage, showing a blast of cherry pie filling, black raspberry tart, cola and smoky oak flavors. The acidity is firm and clean. Feels juvenile, with a jamminess that a few years in the cellar should resolve.",Akiko's Cuvée,89,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
US,"Here's a tight, acidic young Chard from this cool-climate appellation. It's showing lots of mineral flavors now, against a background of Meyer lemon and apricot, and the finish is totally dry.",Pacheco Vineyard,86,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kinter Collins
US,"Some Pinots can handle high alcohol. This one feels hot and sweet, not in sugar but in alcohol and glycerine. It merits this score because the tart-like cherry, cocoapuff and cinnamon flavors taste good, but it really needs greater balance.",Gap's Crown,85,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Harrington
US,"This is a pretty nice Pinot that straddles the line between complex and simple. It's very dry and tart with acids, with an earthy, mushroomy profile that carries notes of cherries, blackberries and oak. A good price for a wine of this quality from this appellation.",,87,15,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Taft Street
US,"A terrific wine at a giveaway price, this coastal bottling shows a rich, complex texture and is very dry. The flavors unfold one by one on the palate: cherries, cocoa, cola, plums, blackberries and spices are highlighted by a burst of crisp acids.",Reserve,89,13,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Smells fresh and invigorating, but in the mouth it has raisiny flavors. This is a young Pinot, rich in acids and tannins, but that overripe quality limits ageability and makes the wine a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,85,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"Decent Pinot-esque wine, with good coastal acidity and a silky delicacy to the mouthfeel, but needs richer flavors. Shows suggestions of cherries, pomegranates and cola that are disappointingly thin.",Reserve,84,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois
US,"The vineyard is in the extreme, “true” Sonoma Coast, and it requires a warmer year to fully ripen. This is showing a minty, herbal edge to the cherries and blackberries, and high acidity. It's impossible to make a wine that isn't charming and elegant from this vineyard, but this bottling for all its appeal is not a great success or ageable. Drink now.",McDougall Vineyard,88,55,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
US,"Here's a nice, tasty Pinot that offers plenty of attractive flavor without real complexity. It's light and silky, with spicy cherry, pomegranate, cola, tangerine zest and smoky vanilla flavors. Drink now.",,88,33,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This is a best-barrels blend whose proceeds go charity. The '05 is a blend of Silver Pines, Van der Kamp, Chris Lee and others, and it's gorgeous. Rewards for its high acid, silky feel, so light and airy, and for the intensity of cola, cherry, pomegranate, smoky vanilla cream and Asian spice flavors that last on the finish. Should pick up additional nuance for the next four years.",Auction Block,95,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Showing the depth and nuance that mark great Chardonnay, this benefitted from its chilly location in the Petaluma Gap in this hot vintage. The coolness allowed the grapes to achieve maximally ripe tropical fruit, nectarine and peach flavors, while preserving vital acidity. Extra dry and elegant, it's a Chard that can take up to six years of cellaring without missing a beat.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
US,"I love this Pinot for its dry silkiness, fruit, and the way it's so complex and ever-changing in the glass. Cherries, raspberries, cola, plum skin, mocha and dusty Asian spice are the elementary flavors, amplified by rich oak, but it's not a fruit bomb. It's elegant and complex, exemplifying cool-climate California in a great vintage.",Grand Detour,93,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"The vineyard isn't very far from the Goodin Vineyard, which MacPhail also bottles, but the two wines are very different. This is far riper and more alcoholic, with dense flavors of cherry marmalade and melted chocolate, and a cassis-like liqueur on the finish. It's a glyceriney wine that tastes sweeter than it technically is. Fairly tannic, the wine is best now through 2008.",Pratt Vineyard,92,56,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"The vineyard is in Sebastopol, in the south of the Russian River Valley. Acidity in this wine is very high, almost prickly, while the fruit tends toward cola, rhubarb, just-ripe cherries, rosehip tea and beef bouillion. It seems like the grapes were picked fairly early to yield a more structured Pinot. Doesn't seem like an ager, but could surprise. The finish is succulent.",Goodin Vineyard,92,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.",,91,39,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Here's a dark, big, rich, dry, oaky Pinot Noir. It's huge in black cherry, cocoa, cola, vanilla and spice flavors that dramatically swamp the palate. It's a complex, elegant, silky wine now, delicious on its own, and likely to intensify for four or five years. From Caymus.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,91,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
US,"The cool climate has accentuated the minerality and tangy acidity of this wine, which is its basic structure. Ripeness contributes tantalizing tastes of lime and mango. To this, the winemaker has seasoned brilliantly with oak, which is smoky, caramelly, vanilla-infused and creamy. What a wonderful wine. It makes you wonder how they sell it at this price.",Pacheco Vineyard,91,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kinter Collins
US,"At five-plus years of age, this Chard's fruit takes a backseat to stone, mineral and herb flavors, in addition to its original oak. It's bone dry, with crisp acids. Complex and interesting, it finishes with a dusty earthiness. Drink now.",,90,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lookout Ridge
US,"Made from Dijon clones, this Pinot, from two vineyards in Sebastopol, shows classic coastal character in its firm dryness, crisp acidity, elegant mouthfeel and fruity flavors that, while ripe, finish with a rich touch of earthy mushrooms and herbs. It's a first-rate Pinot, at its youthful best now.",,90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"This is an astonishing value, especially from such a prestigious appellation. Has a silky texture and lush but dry flavors of cherries, raspberries, herbs, mushrooms, coffee and clove that unfold across the palate. Versatile at the table; try with pork tenderloin with plum sauce. With more than 30,000 cases produced, this should be easy to find.",Reserve,90,8,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Plump and smooth, with piquant briary, herbal accents to the strawberry and raspberry flavors. Picks up coffee and chocolate on the finish, along with just a hint of bitterness. A promising effort.",Reserve,88,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois
US,"Fans of sheer volume will exult, but this wine, good as it is, is a bit overblown. It overwhelms with oak as well as berry flavor so ripe, it approaches chocolate-coated raisins. It is an interesting, well-made Pinot, yet would benefit from greater elegance and a lighter, defter touch.",Keefer Ranch,88,45,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lookout Ridge
US,"This big, powerful young wine tastes more alcoholic than the 14% that the label claims it is. It's superripe in cherry, blackberry and cassis flavors, and Grenache-like in the mouth, which means it's a little heavy for a Pinot. If you like this style, you'll love this wine, which came from a vineyard in the county seat, Santa Rosa.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,87,58,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"Rather thick and extracted, almost syrupy in blackberry, spiced plum and coffee flavors. There are some dusty tannins, and the wine turns a little cloying on the finish.",Hirsch Vineyard,86,35,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Beauregard
US,"An intriguing nose of pine needles, slight barnyard, and a hint of dill is layered over ripe black cherries. A dense, yet soft and seductive wine that should reward cellaring with even more complexities.",Hirsch Vineyard,88,46,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"An intensely fragrant floral, ginger, peach, lemon-lime and orange-spice bouquet ushers in this smooth, well-structured wine. The palate shows intricately meshed orange, butterscotch and toasted nut flavors, offset by angular, racy mineral accents. Finishes long and crisp, with refined pineapple, citrus and stony flavors. Enjoyable now but still tight, this should offer even more in two years.",Laura's,93,54,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"One of the nicest California Pinot Grigios we've tasted. Pleasing, lively green apple, citrus, almond and herb notes play from aromatic start to bright, lingering finish. The flavors tend more to the Italian renditions of this grape, yet the fruit expression is all Sonoma. Editors' Choice.",,88,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Part of the Jess Jackson empire of wineries, Hartford has a stellar record over the years across everything it produces, and this Chardonnay doesn't disappoint. It's bone dry and high in acidity, with a stony minerality that frames controlled peach, pear and mango fruit. The wine has that hard-to-define quality of elegant class.",,92,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"Here's a huge, flamboyant Pinot, dramatically young and vibrant in massive black cherry, mocha and cinnamon spice flavors that are wrapped in tannins seemingly made of pure velvet. It's eccentric, and quintessentially Californian. Beware the high alcohol.",Durell Vineyard,91,48,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Loring Wine Company
US,"Hartford is a high-aiming, small winery that's part of the Jess Jackson empire. The single-vineyard Pinots are outstanding, this regional bottling somewhat less so. Still, it catches the cool Sonoma Coast qualities of acidity and elegance. You'll find cherry and green tea flavors, and the wine should develop over the next five years.",,90,30,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
US,"This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love. Lemon peel, apple skin and pear play together well, never becoming distracting, but instead integrating well with one another and the light hint of oak. Food friendly, it's also a great deal.",,90,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Benziger
US,"Taking time to come around aromatically, it opens up with plum and bright red cherry fruit that follow on the palate, a touch of savory tobacco suggested around the tannins. On the finish expect a balance of spice and sweet as black pepper and caramel compete for affection.",,88,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Decoy
US,"An unidentified mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot sourced from throughout the county, this is a smoky, leathery expression of sanguine black and red fruit that's approachable and easygoing. The finish has a bittersweet note of chicory.",Mountain Cuvée,87,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"From vineyards in both Alexander Valley and Bennett Valley, the grapes were fermented in French oak for eight months, a minority of it new. This is a medium-bodied, integrated wine rich in caramel apple and fresh-squeezed tangerine. Brisk and in balance, it finishes with a note of toasted almond.",,90,26,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"A large production offering, this white is simple and direct in its expression of the variety, remaining steely and low in oak on the palate, with a depth of green apple and melon fruit.",,85,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Decoy
US,"A majority of Grenache and tiny bit of Mourvèdre from Kick Ranch and McGah Vineyard were racked to concrete egg for fermentation, with the intent of preserving freshness. Successful in that quest, this orange-pink wine is dry, tangy and well-integrated in terms of acidity, subtle in cranberry, dried cherry and orange, with a light, refreshing finish.",,90,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Rosé,Kale
US,"A field blend of 85% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante Bouschet and 4% Petite Sirah, this juicy, spicy wine is robust and full bodied.

US,"Dark in color and deeply flavored, as the name suggests, this blend has evocative blackberry, currant, grilled meat, black pepper and oak flavors. It's also tannic, suggesting cellaring until 2019.",Dark & Brooding,90,54,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Palmeri
US,"A tremendous value, this white is light and floral, soft in honeyed stone fruit and pineapple. A nice minerality buoys the proceedings, a medium-body taking on new strength midway through before letting the wine finish crisp and clean.",,88,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"Cherry and cassis notes provide a touch of brighness on the nose and palate of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Cabernet Franc, 26% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec, but its plum-raisin backdrop and dullness on the finish suggest it might be going downhill.",The Classic Four,84,27,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Spann Vineyards

Black cherries, currants, mocha, plums, vanilla and fragrant sandalwood all come together to provide a complex drink that's firm in tannins and fancy in the finish. Drink now.",Grand Reserve,90,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Made in a relatively restrained style, this is a dark, juicy and smoky wine from Dry Creek and Alexander Valley area vineyard sites. Lengthy and smooth, it takes a decidedly medium-bodied route, with traces of leather pouch on the nose and a soft layering of milk chocolate on the finish.",,90,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Decoy

US,"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything.",Complicated,91,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Taken Wine Co.
US,"Call this Zin lusty, huge, gigantic, massive, anything that describes scale. Some Zins like this are over the top, but this one maintains a precarious balance, despite high alcohol and superripe raisin and dark chocolate flavors. With firm tannins, it's classic Monte Rosso Zinfandel, and will age for decades.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,90,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rock Wall

US,"This old Sonoma grapegrowing family's hommage to their forebears is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. It is an excellent wine, succulently filled with juicy flavors of cherries and blackcurrants, with sexy tannins that are muscular, but negotiable. It will probably soften in a few years.",Omaggio,91,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Seghesio
US,"Richer and more complete than the '98 La Joie, with which it was simultaneously released. This wine shows its mountain origins in its tough young tannins and hard edges, but there is enough cherry and blackberry fruit for the long haul.

US,"Give this dynamic young Cabernet blend a good decanting or a little time in the cellar to mellow and let its edges round off.

US,"A lovely Cabernet Franc, one of the best on the market. Shows classic Pride Mountain characteristics of ripeness, balance and immediate drinkability, although it will take a few years in the cellar.

US,"As fine a Cabernet as Coppola has ever produced (exclusive, of course, of Rubicon), this one's as deep and fancy as almost anything from Napa Valley. Strikes you immediately with a wealth of sweet, oak-infused blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors. The tannins are immaculate. This dramatic Cab will develop for the remainder of the decade.",Archimedes,94,52,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Francis Ford Coppola

US,"A very good interpretation of Sangiovese. A pretty sharp mouthfeel, but maybe that's to be expected from this high-acid variety. Otherwise, it's nice and dry, with complex cherry, red currant, licorice, leather and sandalwood flavors. Good with spicy beef, pork and veal dishes.",Lola,87,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Stave 28
US,"Huge flavors in this creamy wine, exploding in pineapples, limes, kiwi fruit and peaches, with a tangy edge of gooseberry. It's dry and acidic and clean. Tastes a little honey sweet, but the tartness balances.",Kick Ranch,86,21,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Carica

US,"Smells and tastes super-oaky, with dominating notes of vanilla, clove, dill and caramel. Although there's a ton of cherry, chocolate and raspberry fruit, sweet vanilla and toast still is the main element. Maybe it's going through a dumb phase and simply needs time. Try again after 2011.",Vintner Select,87,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
US,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy. For some reason, the winery lowered the price considerably from the 2005, which was a much better wine.",55% Slope,87,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge
US,"Zinfandel is not usually a wine you have to age, but this one does need four years or so in the cellar. It's bone dry and quite good, with classic wild berry, tobacco, grilled meat and spice flavors, but it's pretty tannic. Has the depth and balance to blossom by, say, 2015.",Scherrer Vineyard,90,27,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Greenwood Ridge

Drink now.",Zinfandel-,86,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Watkins Family

US,"Lusty and voluptuous are two words that describe this bone-dry Syrah. Heat from high alcohol accentuates the black currant, raisin and pepper flavors, and thick, rich tannins make it a full-bodied partner for beef. Could develop with two years in the bottle.",Kalen's Big Boy Blend,87,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Eric Kent

US,"Six Degrees scored bigtime with their 2005 release of this single-vineyard Cab, but the '06, while quite elegant, is a bit off the mark.

US,"One-dimensional in fruit, but clean and zesty, and likeable for its wealth of orange, Asian pear, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. The finish is off-dry and spicy.",,85,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Riesling,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Heavy, tannic and dense now, but clearly well-grown, this Bordeaux blend wants a little time in the cellar to knit together. An unusual blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot, it's rich and captivating in black currants and cassis, with a long, spicy finish. Shows masterful blending talent, combining grapes from the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. Hold until after 2012.",Le Petit Malin,90,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,William Knuttel

It's good as a cocktail sipper, or with everything from Asian food to fried chicken.",,85,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Kenwood
US,"This is the best value of the winery's spring lineup of seven 2012 Pinot Noirs. It's dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, tart and complex. Waves of raspberries and cherries, mushrooms, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices wash across the palate, delicious and flashy. It's ready to drink now.",,93,39,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Easily one of the greatest California Merlots ever. Notable for its complete balance. Nothing sticks out; all the parts work together. The black cherry, plum, black currant, dark chocolate and licorice fruit is big, but perfectly balanced with smoky, sweet oak, while a subtle touch of violets brings a smack of the earth. The tannin-acid structure is just beautiful. Will continue to develop bottle complexity for at least six more years.",Reserve,96,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",Reserve,95,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean

US,"Deerfield is one of the few wineries that holds their Syrah back for so long, but the bottling has varied over the years. The '03, at the age of five-plus, is rich in currant, herb and cocoa-dusted cappuccino flavors, but a little flat. Probably at its best now.",Ladi's Vineyard,85,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Deerfield Ranch

US,"The winery's reserve Chard has consistently been the best among their five Chards. The '05 is a dramatic wine, although oak-o-phobes might find it toothpicky. It is smoky and buttery and caramelly, but a year or so should knit that together with the ripe tropical fruits and make the wine seamlessly complex.",Reserve,94,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean

Dry and balanced, it shows classic flavors of blackberries and black currants, with earthier notes of olive tapenade and carob.",Sonoma County Mountains,89,49,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Roy J. Maier
US,"This is a very fruity Cabernet in which blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and cola star, along with oak influences. It's bone dry, and the tannins are thick and firm, but finely ground. Jammy and immature, the wine wants time in the cellar. Hold until after 2013 and see what happens.",Incline One-Nine Reserve,88,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bugay
US,"Bone dry and delicately structured, it has good acidity cutting across herb tea, apricot, orange rind and white pepper flavors. The wine shows some true complexity and interest.",Rosé of,88,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Grenache,Stark
US,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors.",,84,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"A fairly standard Zin that plays it right down the middle. It's dry, clean and spicy, with wild berry and tobacco flavors wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink now.",,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sebastiani
US,"The dryness and minerality of this wine, combined with its clean, brisk elegance, make it a very nice partner for shellfish. The flavors are lemons, limes, and ripe, crisp white peaches.",,89,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"This Merlot over-delivers for the everyday price. It's bone dry and classically structured, with rich, ripe tannins and mouthwatering acidity framing flavors of cherries, red and black currants, dusty spices and cedar. Sommeliers, scoop this one up. More than 15,000 cases produced.",L de Lyeth,87,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Lyeth
US,"Soft in texture, this Zin has flavors of freshly crushed, ripe blackberries, cherries and raspberries, cocoa and black pepper, with a burnt brown-butter, baked pastry crust edge. It's pretty tannic, which makes it a good foil for rich meats and cheeses. Decant for an hour or two.",Old Vines,88,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wild Oak by St. Francis
US,"This Zin is so fresh and jammy in raspberries, cherries and blackberries, you wonder why they didn't hold it back for a while, to let the flavors meld. Tasted in March 2008, it still had that acid-forward, crushed berry tartness you find in wine straight out of the fermenter. But it's a very good Zin that will improve in the bottle. This should be at its best by this winter and into 2009.",Ponzo Vineyard,88,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hawley
US,"Feels like Chardonnay, with full-bodied vanilla cream, pineapple and buttered toast flavors, but veers in its own direction with a strong note of tangerines. Delicious now with seared scallops.",,87,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon
US,"Give this young Zin some time in the bottle. It's too jammy and thick to show its best now. With a rich core of blackberries, chocolate, leather, plums and spices that are wrapped into significant tannins, it should meld together by the middle of 2010.",,88,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ledson
US,"With raspberry, cola and pomegranate flavors, this Pinot is satisfying and even somewhat complex. It's soft and gentle in the mouth, and ready to drink now.",Nichole's Blend,87,39,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Spell
US,"Very dry and a little hard in tannins, the winery's '05 Cab doesn't show the richness of the '04 or even the '03. But it has good structure, with enough cherry and currant flavors to satisfy. Drink now.",,84,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valley of the Moon
US,"This small-production reserve Cab from one of Sonoma's premier wineries is notable for its power. The tannins are quite firm, giving an astringent bite, while the fruity-oaky flavors are massive. Cherries, blackberries, raspberries, spicy plums, vanilla, cocoa and char just explode, yet the wine maintains balance. Good as it is, it's a young wine that will benefit from several years in the bottle.",Reserve,90,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Four-plus years haven't helped to soften or sweeten this tough, herbal Cab. It's bone dry and lean, even austere in flavor, leaving the alcohol and powerful tannins to dominate.",,83,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington

It's drinkable now, with a tart, acidic streak through the finish that calls for rich grills and cheeses.",Ladi's Vineyard,87,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Paradise Ridge
US,"This is such a wonderful value. It's rich in cherry, blackberry and cocoa flavors, and perfectly dry. Lives up to Merlot's soft, approachable reputation, but there's real complexity. A dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds depth and structure to this drinkable Merlot.",,87,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Gallo of Sonoma

US,"Very dry and crisp in acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc, which has never seen oak, shows bright fruit flavors of pink grapefruits, oranges, kiwis and pears, with a streak of minerality. It turns a little green and aggressive on the finish. A clean, stimulating wine for drinking now.",Les Pionniers,88,36,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Capture
US,"This wine is clean, good and tasty. It's not especially complex, but shows berry, cherry, spice and oak flavors that are wrapped in a soft, balanced package.",,86,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Paradise Ridge

US,"Deep briary, wild-berry and pepper aromas. In the mouth, it's ripe and sweetly fruity, with soft tannins and pepper-spice notes. It's bone dry, with adequate acidity. Classic Sonoma Zin in its expressive exuberance and unpolished likeability.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,88,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"Ripe and juicy, with intense blackberry jam and mocha flavors, this smoothly textured wine has rich tannins, perhaps from a majority of Dry Creek Valley grapes. With some sweetness on the finish, it's ready to drink now.",Kreck Family Vineyards,85,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mill Creek
US,"Here's a Merlot that's a little everyday, a little fancy. It has a velvety texture and currant, plum and oaky flavors. The downside is astringent tannins—the puckery kind that make the tongue stick to the roof of the mouth.",Healdsburg Ranches,85,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Belvedere
US,"Here's a clean, dry, elegant wine showing quite a bit of creamy, smoky oak and sophisticated peach, kiwi and apricot flavors. The Chard dominates. Viognier seems to bring acidic lift and a floral note.",,85,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Viognier,Spann Vineyards
US,"I have not been a great fan of this winery's Bordeaux reds, and this one also has a countrified thing going on, despite some very ripe and lip-smacking cherry flavors. Half the oak barrels it was aged in were new.",Rockpile Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Paradise Ridge
US,"This wine was sent to me with little information about the owners, and their Web Site doesn't reveal much. The paperwork says it's from Knights Valley, although the label reads Sonoma County. It's a dry, fairly tannic wine, quite ripe in currants and dark chocolate, with an herbal edge and a firm structure. Aged in 100% new French oak, it impresses for its richness and depth, and could develop over the next 6–8 years.",,92,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Huge Bear

US,"A nice, rich Gewürztraminer that shows the spicy flavors and fruit you want in this varietal.

Straddles the border between dry and off-dry.",,86,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Kenwood
US,"Solid, with pleasant blackberry, cherry, blueberry and spice flavors. A little soft, but nice and dry and drinkable.",,86,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"Opens with aromas of wild berries, white pepper, earth and a trace of leather. Tough and unyielding tannins coat the palate, and you'll need some meat to break through this gridlock, but underneath it all is a core of ripe dark-berry fruit. This could use 3–6 years of aging.",Morning Sun,86,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"This is a challenging Zin. It's fruity but it's also earthy and mushroomy, with a blast of vanilla oak. Right now it's pretty tannic, but beneath that roughness is a core of fruit. It's austere now—difficult even—but some time in the cellar could soften and open it.",Rocky Terrace,86,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood

US,"Paradise Ridge has struggled with Cab, and continues to. This one's ripe and juicy in Cabernet fruit, but has a stubborn rusticity and jagged mouthfeel it can't quite overcome. It's a good Cab, but I think this vineyard is simply better for Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",Rockpile Vineyard,84,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paradise Ranch
US,"Feels young and gritty in the mouth, with astringent tannins and a core of cherry-berry fruit. This wine is seriously in need of decanting, but it doesn't seem like an ager.",Ladi's Vineyard,84,27,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paradise Ridge
US,"Nice and rich in toasty oak, framing mouthfilling flavors of pineapples, papaya, peach and cinnamon spice. Feels creamy-smooth, with a good tang of acidity.",,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"Cab Franc alone rarely makes a great wine in California, and this one's no exception. It's awfully nice in initial raspberry-cherry flavors, but loses substantial power and vitality midpalate, especially given the size of the tannins.",,86,56,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
US,"Light and crisp, this tart little Pinot boasts just enough cola and black cherry flavors to make it a worthwhile match with roast chicken, or perhaps grilled salmon.",,85,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois

US,"The vineyard is up in the Mayacamas between Spring Mountain and Sonoma Valley, and the wine shows quite a bit of power. Coming from this hot vintage, it's also very ripe and fruity, in a California way. But it's classically structured and dry, and the tannins are softly complex. This delicious, ageable Cab is a worthy followup to the '03.",Brigden Vineyard,92,48,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Owl Ridge
US,"A little rustic around the edges, with that briary, brambly taste of freshly picked wild berries, this dry Zin hails from a vineyard straddling Dry Creek and Alexander valleys. It's exuberant in spicy flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries and cola.",,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
US,"This is a brisk, clean wine, marked by tart acidity that scours the palate and prepares it for food. The followup flavors are of spicy tropical citrus fruits and green, savory gooseberries. The grapes are from a coolish vineyard near Santa Rosa.",Kick Ranch,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Enkidu
US,"The flagship of the Peter Michael Chardonnays is a stylish, sexy wine. Opens with a wonderful nose of peach, tropical fruit, nuts and orange tea; it shows great poise and a classic sense of proportion from bouquet to finish. The wine unfolds and expands in the glass, offering lovely orange, mineral and tarragon flavors. The engaging finish has great length and subtle aromas and flavors. Impressive for its restraint and attention to detail, this is delicious now but will also reward keeping. Cellar Selection.",Cuvee Indigene,92,85,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
US,"This wine's fat, tropical fruit, banana and toast nose has a pungent, spicy Gewürztraminer quality. The palate is the payoff. It shows the aforementioned elements, plus cinnamon, clove and vanilla flavors. What you get is a ripe, unctuous wine—big, maybe even a bit overblown, but totally lovable. The long, spicy finish of this unique bottling is impressive.",Reserve,91,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ledson
US,"Displaying great fruit and excellent structure, this can be enjoyed now, but it has soon scale and intensity that we suggest aging it for at least another year or two. Barelli seems to yield darkly-fruited wines of depth and structure that read somewhat tighter and harder in their youth. Has classic cassis, toasty oak and tobacco touches, plus a dusty Alexander Valley feel.",Barelli Creek,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Lots of spice along with a veritable fruit cocktail of complex flavors open this understated performer. From green apple and bosc pears to melon and mint, it has an elegant integration of fruit and spicy, vanillin oak. Tangy acidity keeps it lively, and the wine finishes crisp and dry. Still tight, this could use a year to knit itself together.",Stone Côte Vineyard,91,33,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"It's said that Dick Arrowood personally checks every bottle that goes out—his attention to detail shows here. A complex and refined bouquet of toasted oat, coconut, orange and peach opens to a full palate of apple, yellow plum and caramel flavors. Rich and creamily textured, it is also high on spice and smoky oak. The complex finish is very long, leesy and elegantly nuanced.",Reserve Speciale Cuvée Michel Berthoud,91,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Arrowood

US,"A little raw, with sharp elbows of tannins and acids. Don't be too fussy, just enjoy the plummy, grapy flavors.",,84,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Bois
US,"Crème brûlée creaminess combines with tart citrus fruitiness in this wine, which displays great balance and richness. A nice oak frame holds it all together and provides a handsome framework for the lime-orange-tangerine citrus core. The palate has buttery caramel and wintergreen accents. Long, serene finish.",Reserve,91,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
US,"A tart pineapple-lemon nose with caramel and smoke accents ushers in a full palate. Apple and pear flavors add body, and a chalky note contributes complexity and texture to the palate. Slight creaminess provides a fat, full feel, but maybe just a bit more softness than some tasters preferred. Still, this is a solid wine with finesse and body. It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.",Mon Plaisir,90,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
US,"In this fine offering from one of this tasting's most consistent performers, a nutty, pineapple-ginger nose opens to a lively mouth of citrus, hazelnut and spice. The feel is firm, elegant. This handsomely constructed wine finishes long with subtle white peach notes, with dashes of tangy spice and chalk.",Belle Côte,90,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery

US,"A Bordeaux blend, and a nice one at that, with layers of berry and herb flavors. Shows great structure, with dusty oak tannins and juicy acidity, and while the fruit could be more concentrated, the wine finishes with elegant style.",Cuvée de la Luna,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Valley of the Moon
US,"This is one of the zestier, zingier blush wines out there. It attacks the mouth with a lightning blast of acidity that wakes up the tastebuds, and is totally dry. Made from 90% Zinfandel and 10% Pinot Noir, the racy flavors are of slightly underripe raspberries, mint and rosehip tea.",Miss Hobo,86,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Rosé,Hobo
US,"This Chardonnay, from a small vineyard block in Jess Jackson's Alexander Mountain estate, is grand yet graceful. Oozing pear, butterscotch, melon and menthol flavors, it shows good weight and a positive richness that's supported by firm structure. It's balanced, appealing, admirably not overoaked and finishes long with flavors of melon, spice and pear offset by toasty accents. Top Value.",Block Sixty-Six,90,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"Fine flavor definition and very good acidity. Citrus, apple and herb aromas sing on the nose. Round apple, anise and pineapple show on the velvety palate.

Enticing, but still tight enough to warrant holding it for a year or two.",La Carriere,90,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
US,"Helen Turley's Chardonnay shows nice complexity, particularly on the nose, where nuanced oriental spice, tobacco, nectarine, floral and yellow fruit aromas play with the senses. The palate is mild and balanced, with melon, stone fruit and nut flavors, and a smooth texture to boot. Just a touch of heat shows on the long, dry yet spicy finish.",Gauer Vineyard,89,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Canepa
US,"The primary source of this Zin is from Dry Creek Valley. It's rare to find this quality and quantity of upfront fruit in a Zin that's so balanced, but here it is.

US,"Juicy and crisp, with green apple, lime and cinnamon granola flavors. Finishes clean and spicy.",,86,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Christine Andrew
US,"Here's a wine with the polished features of a nice Saint-Julien. Opens with refined aromas of cedar and cassis, then turns complex in the mouth, with cherry, raspberry, spice and oak flavors. Feels too soft for cellaring, though.",Mohrhardt Ridge,86,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"Announces itself with an unusual and pleasant Gewürtztraminer-like tangerine, lychee and ginger nose. Its mild but decidedly unique character is clearer on the melon, butter-cinnamon and peach palate. Nice acidity and a tangy-spicy finish.",Kent Ritchie Vineyard,89,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Scott Paul
US,"Nice sweet-tart flavors and a medium mouthfeel make this is one of our most-enjoyed California renditions of Tuscany's workhorse red.

US,"Lovely aromas, flavors and a fine mouthfeel define this rare item—a real Pinot Noir value. Appealing black cherry, earth, and tarragon aromas and flavors keep the taster interested, suggesting a broad range of food pairings, from salmon to lamb. It even offers decent body and length, almost unheard of in this price range.",,88,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.",Whitney's Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fisher
US,"This field-style blend of Petite Sirah, Carignane and Syrah is super-jammy, with jellied flavors of raspberries, cherries, blueberries, blackberries and loganberries. It's a fun, fairly complicated wine that finishes dry and tannic.",Old Patch Red,86,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Trentadue
US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind. This full-bodied, nicely textured Chardonnay has nutty, smoky and spicy flavors melding with tangy tropical fruit to create a tasty, fairly lush wine that's easy to enjoy. Finishes soft, with a faint whiff of petrol—in the Alsace manner—and is drinking well now.",David Selby Reserve,88,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Selby
US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas. More candy apple-like flavors appear in the mouth, accompanied by tropical fruit and toasty accents with a rich caramel tone. It verges on too-sweet, but it's nonetheless pleasing in an uncomplicated way.",,87,33,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.",Sangiacomo Vineyards Reserve,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bernardus
US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors. Mouthfeel is dry and briskly acid—but with a nice chalky note, too. Chalk shows again on the finish, where it somewhat checks the sharp lemony-metallic notes.",Seascape Vineyard,87,46,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness. It's slightly hot, with dominant butterscotch and vanillin oaky flavors.",Upper Barn,87,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.",Barelli Creek Vineyard,86,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Barbera,E & J Gallo

US,"Solid black currant and cedar aromas and flavors predominate in this dry, well-structured red. Toasty oak complements dark, dusty Alexander Valley fruit.

US,"Even with a drop of Merlot and Malbec added, this still is a fairly simple wine, flavor-wise. It satisfies for basic dryness and tannic structure, with a bit of cherry-blackberry fruit.",,84,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Benziger
US,"Both Old and New World elements are evident in this Shiraz. The round, easy mouthfeel and nose of berry, chocolate and cumin say “New World.” The palate has more Old World notes of leather, game and dry licorice surrounding the fruit core. Dark oak, licorice and tart berry flavors play out on the complex finish.",,89,39,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Shiraz,Wattle Creek

US,"Let this very young, tart Sauvignon Blanc breathe for a while. That will get rid of most of the feline essence, which are really strong on opening, and let richer notes of figs, melons and citrus fruits emerge.",,83,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Schug

US,"A fig, herb and grapefruit bouquet sets the stage. The fig element becomes a more nut-like flavor on the palate and the wine has a round, slightly viscous texture, in the full style of the other Wattle Creek whites. Finishes dry, with just a hint of tartness.",,87,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wattle Creek

US,"Pretty aromas of cherries, chocolate, and vanilla open into berry flavors that are balanced, rich and very dry, with some dusty tannins. Has a round elegance that's tableworthy.",Signature Series,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Windsor
US,"The aromas are herbal, flirting dangerously with green pepper before eventually settling somewhere between oregano and tea. The juicy black cherries on the palate compensate somewhat, and the oak is understated. Best with herb-laced beef or lamb to help accentuate the fruit.",Vineyards of TreMonte,86,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Ferrari-Carano
US,"They say the vines average 80 years of age, which means who knows where those old roots have explored. For that matter, who knows what the grape varieties really are. The wine is the least fruity of the winery's current Zins. While it shows berry-cherry and licorice flavors, it's notable for hard-to-describe earthy, mineral and mushroomy tastes that are interesting and unique.",Old Vine,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"With 17% alcohol, this Zin still has residual sugar. They must have picked the grapes insanely ripe. It's not a table wine, it's more like Port, but it's not without its pleasures.",St. Peter's Church Vineyard,80,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"The initial aromas of barrel-aging cellar—sweet, dusty wood mixed with plummy, grapey fruit—give way to flavors of black cherries and toast that extend through the supple finish.",Barrel Select,85,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Fetzer
US,"Aromas of toast and cedar blend in a little mint over black cherries. This wine has pretty flavors of cherries, cedar, bitter chocolate and tea, but possesses a certain austerity and restraint. Finishes with some dry tannins; you could age this wine, but you'd be taking a chance—much better to enjoy it now.",Proprietor Grown,84,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Hanna
US,Savory dried herbs accent the otherwise soft and simple black cherries that dominate this wine. Closes with some sweet cola and chocolate notes. A solid by-the-glass offering.,,84,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Clos du Bois
US,"You get mostly cedar and charred oak at first, with hints of cherries and mocha. This is one affordable Merlot that doesn't lack for structure—it's just that the structure seems largely wood-derived, leaving insufficient fruit flesh to fill in the gaps.",,82,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Geyser Peak
US,"Dry, tart and fairly one-dimensional, this Cab has mixed flavors of blackberries, cherries and Kahlúa, with a peppery, minty streak. The tannins are a bit edgy. Might improve with a year or two of cellaring.",,85,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
US,"Classic Northern California Cabernet at a fair price, which makes it a value these days. It begins with aromas of black currants, anise and smoky, charry oak, and doesn't disappoint on the palate. There's plenty of polished blackberry and currant fruit, with a nice blast of oak. Very dry and clean. You notice how well it scours the mouth and stays crisp and elegant on the finish.",,88,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"After a string of great vintages, this bottling is a disappointment. After four-plus years, it remains quite tannic, with an acidic astringency.",Artist Series,84,70,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"A tremendous Zinfandel. Combines sheer volume of power fruit with finesse to essentially define the variety. With rich acidity and some firm, chewy tannins, it's brilliantly dry, displaying blackberry tart, black currant, cola, mocha, bacon and pepper flavors, dusted with savory Indian spices. A very great Zinfandel whose high alcohol is simply part of the wine's personality.",Riebli Valley Vineyard,94,48,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"An exquisite wine that combines delicacy and harmony with enormously fruity-spicy flavors that fill the mouth. The aromas suggest candied ginger, tropical fruits, vanilla and wildflowers. The flavors are effusively fruity and on the dry side, with refreshingly crisp acidity. Try it with Asian-Pacific fusion foods.",,87,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Mark West
US,"Couldn't be riper or more powerful in flavor, a Chard that just detonates with explosive pineapple tart filling, honey, vanilla and crème brûlée. Could use a bit of subtlety, but fans of pure Chardonnay flavor will be delighted.",Durell Vineyard,89,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"A likable, easy-drinking Chard that won't bust your budget, with plenty of ripe flavors and winemaker bells and whistles. It's got spicy, vanilla-accented peach aromas, and while it drinks a bit thin, it's got some class and style. The finish lasts for a pretty long time, with oaky, spicy flavors. This is a good value, especially from a top winery. Best Buy.",,87,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"This wine captures Pinot's silky, spicy qualities, although it's thin, light and basic. Some pretty notes of raspberry, smoke, sun-dried tomato, mushroom and chocolate and a nice, spicy intensity on the palate. The tannins are soft and light, and it snaps to a quick finish.",,86,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois
US,"A supple, polished Cabernet that shows real style and class at a price consistent with its quality. Soft and dry, it has rich flavors of blackberries, chocolate, green olives, herbs and cedar. Now through 2010 for freshness.",,88,27,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Lees and oak dominate the nose of this very ripe wine. The result is size: A big, rich, oaky, fruity quaff, it fills the mouth with flavors and palate impressions. At the same time, it's a one-dimensional wine; it assaults the senses, but on one plane. Finishes semi-sweet.",,85,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Light, tasty and simple, it offers up pretty aromas of red raspberries, smoke and vanilla. In the mouth it's fruity and soft. There's good extracted fruit and a generous dusting of oak. It can't quite achieve complexity, but it's a nice wine that's thoroughly enjoyable.",,85,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mark West
US,"For some reason, the winery held the '06 back later than the 2007. Maybe because it was so tannic. Still is, with a biting, palate-shutting astringency made harder by the wine's extreme dryness. But there's a place for tannic, dry Syrahs, and this is a very good one, with precisely measured oak framing deep, impressive blackberry, leather and black pepper flavors.",Three Coins Betsy's Vineyard,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Lawer
US,"Blackstone's been working hard on their Pinot, and with this new Sonoma Reserve line, they've produced their best ever. It's a rich, dry wine that seems to have both cool- and warm-climate notes. Shows cherry pie, cola, blackberry tart and spice flavors, although it's a bit on the soft side.",Sonoma Reserve,88,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blackstone
US,"A blend of Zin, Merlot, Syrah, Carignan and several others, this is the anti-Napa red wine. It has an austerity, acidity and dryness that will elegantly show off complex food without dominating it. A very nice effort from Pellegrini.",Cuvée 107,88,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Pellegrini
US,"From a value leader, another rich, creamy, toasty Chard, loaded with peach, apple and pear flavors and a lot of oak. Good acidity and a long finish, but it has a little too much sugar to be considered dry.",,85,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Château Souverain
US,"This is a really nice Chardonnay. Sebastiani knows how to make a balanced varietal wine, and this clean, ripe Chardonnay completely satisfies, with fruity flavors and a rich balance of creamy oak, coastal acidity and spicy oak.",,88,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
US,"A delicious Pinot, but not particularly complex. With direct, primary cherry marmalade and jellied mint flavors, accented with a bit of oak, it's dry and crisp. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Lots of rich, ripe, forward fruit in this well-oaked wine, with tart green apple, pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors. It's stylishly dry, with a nice, creamy finish.",Sonoma Reserve,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Blackstone
US,"Another success from Sebastiani. Dry and smooth, this has rich blackberry and oak flavors grounded in earthy tannins, and finishes dry and stylishly elegant. It could be your house Cab without breaking the bank.",,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"A lovely white wine marked by savory crispness and bright flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and other zesty citrus fruits. Finishes dry and clean, with little or no oak influence.",,87,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Cline
US,"Softly elegant and dry, this is a lovely Bordeaux blend to pair with a wide variety of meats and cheeses. Structure is the star, with grapeskin and oak barrel tannins framing delicate cherry, herb and earth flavors.",Sonoma Reserve Meritage,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackstone
US,"This 100%  Sauv is delicately structured and dry and crisp in acidity. While it has a touch of oak, the fruit has been allowed to star. Lemon, lime, green apple, fig, honeydew and vanilla all come together in this pure, fresh wine.",,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This is a nice, smooth and fairly sophisticated Merlot for immediate drinking. It's totally dry, with young tannins to cut through rich meats, and the cherry-blackberry fruit is balanced with an earthy, bitter coffee edge that gets the mouth watering.",Sonoma Reserve,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Blackstone
US,"As much as I like this Merlot, it feels like they let it get too ripe and gave it too much oak. It was a great vintage, and the grapes ripened effortlessly. Yet there's a baked fruit, toothpicky oakiness that robs the wine of elegance.",,86,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood
US,"Powerful in Zinny character, this blend of Dry Creek and Russian River grapes bursts with brawny flavors of wild berries, chocolate-covered mint, tobacco and pepper, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Shows real class and character.",Heritage,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Ultra-soft and a bit hot from high alcohol, this red wine is made in the modern cult style. It tastes of melted milk chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis and smoky new oak, with a hint of Port.",Ossidiana,87,125,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Viansa
US,"Lush and full-bodied, if not especially complex, this is a wine to drink now. It shows easy flavors of blackberries, currants, sage, pepper, mint and cedar, wrapped into sturdy tannins.",,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Meritage,Magistrate
US,"A deeply flavored, smooth Cabernet with the balance and elegance to drink with fine fare. It feels rich and plush, with aggressive tannins that frame ripe flavors of black cherries, red currants, cola, herbs and oak. Could even age for 2-4 years, although beyond that is a gamble.",,88,29,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Egret
US,"I like the varietal richness of this Gewürz. It shows powerful, classic tropical fruit and wildflower flavors, with potent cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and vanilla spices that dominate the finish. A bit soft, but a very nice wine for the price.",,85,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Kenwood
US,"If you're looking for a kosher Chard, try this one. It's a fine wine, rich in fruit, well-oaked and balanced, with the creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel you want in this varietal. The peach custard, pineapple and kiwi flavors are simply delicious.",Cellar Select,88,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Weinstock Cellars
US,"Very sweet, with powerful apricot, tangerine, pineapple and creme brulee flavors and good acidity to balance out the sugar. Vanilla ice cream would be a good match.",Soleil Late Harvest,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Dry and herbal, with tobacco, thyme and cedar flavors, and an island of wild blackberries floating in the middle. The considerable tannins make the wine astringent. Probably at its best for the next few years.",,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Deerfield

US,"Ripe, almost overripe, with a taste of raisins in the finish, but that's just one aspect of this pretty little Zin's personality. It's dry and tannic and spicy, and very flavorful in berries and cedar. Nice with grilled fare, a great summertime BBQ wine.",zin-a,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Diablita
US,"Strongly flavored, with jammy raspberry and cherry pie flavors accented with sweet vanilla, cinnamon spice and smoky cedar wood. A good, tasty Pinot Noir meant for drinking soon.",,87,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lyeth
US,"I like the light-bodied texture, acidity and delicate mouthfeel of this wine, with its pretty lemonade, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. But the finish is too sugary-sweet.",,83,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"Still pretty tannic at nearly four years of age, this Merlot is also very dry, and it has a tart acidity. Structurally, it's a rustic wine, whose cherry-blackberry flavors have a weedy, minty, herbal edge.",,83,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Sonoma Vineyards
US,"Pretty thin in fruit, which makes the bare-bones alcohol, acids and oak stick out.",,83,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Creek
US,"Doesn't seem to have much, if any, oak on it, but it doesn't matter, because the underlying wine is so good, at such a nice price. Crisp and steely, it shows rich flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and pears.",L de Lyeth,87,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lyeth
US,"A very good, everyday Bordeaux-style blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, and made in a large quantity. Although the tannins are a bit green, it offers attractive flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants and cedar.",,87,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Meritage,Lyeth
US,"A bit divisive among our panelists, with one finding it rather light and lacking in intensity, while others found virtue in its understated yet varietally correct nature. Cola and cherry flavors finish clean and fresh.",Reserve,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,"A bit rugged and rustic in the mouth, but dry and very ripe, with chocolate-infused blackberry pie, mushu plum sauce and cedar flavors. The blend is Cab, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",Director's Cut Cinema,86,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Francis Ford Coppola

US,"Here's one of the more versatile white wines out there, something you can serve with almost anything and be confident. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay, it hits all the bases, with rich fruit and spices, crisp acidity, and a creamy texture.",Spinning White,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,White Blend,Curveball
US,"Here's an extraordinarily rich, flavorful red wine and here's how you should use it. Take a slab of beef, give it a super spice rub, then grill it, maybe with some veggies, and enjoy. Nothing complicated here, just loads of fresh fruits, currants and spices, wrapped into sturdy tannins.",Red Rex,87,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Deerfield
US,"Fruit fans will love the explosive blackberry, cherry, raspberry and vanilla mocha flavors of this wine. On the other hand, it's a bit obvious, with no real subtlety. Defines the easy, ripe California style.",Lot 161,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Meritage,Cameron Hughes

US,"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo.",Old Vines,91,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis
US,"Young, tight, firm fruit, with nuances of blueberry dominating. Tannic, dry and tight, it's well made with excellent structure and balance. Tight right now, high-toned and tart, but with a good, long life ahead.",San Lorenzo,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio

Great all-purpose Zin.",OVOC,90,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alderbrook
US,"Here's a soft, plushly textured Merlot, with polished cherry, blackberry and toast flavors and a dry finish. It's a pleasant sipper, and will benefit from decanting before serving to let it breathe and develop.",,85,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,L de Lyeth

US,"A bit common, with a scoury texture and decent flavors of pineapples, apples and oak, with a very dry, acidic finish.",Wild Oak,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever. It's just plain delicious, old-vine, succulent juice. Jammy, juicy, vibrant and tight, it has a long life ahead.",Geyserville,90,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ridge
US,"Good, bright, spicy fruit, with fine balance and a silky, extended finish. There's lovely concentration in the back end, suggesting blackberries and loganberries and plenty of toast.",Home Ranch,89,26,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"Good, tangy red fruit, with youthful vigor and zest. Nuances of citrus rind, cranberry and toast; it's compact and sleek, still young and tight, but perfectly balanced and precision-tuned.",,88,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Grgich Hills
US,"A bit too soft, which makes the exceptionally ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors stand alone and lack structure. Tasty and flashy, but the palate longs for more acids and tannins.",Reserve,85,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viansa
US,"Dry and gritty in texture, with hard-edged, jagged tannins, this wine is very ripe. It has strong black cherry, blackberry and coffee flavors, and needs to be decanted before serving.",Meritage,84,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Lyeth
US,"Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak. Finishes dry, with somewhat more discernable blackberry and vanilla notes and moderately puckering tannins. Best for keeping; try in two-plus years.",St. Peter's Church Vineyard,88,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish. The fruit is subsumed to clove and tobacco flavors; best with strongly spiced grilled foods.",Old Vines,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
US,"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors. Well made and approachable, with some added interest from Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre in the blend.",Old Vines,87,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sebastiani

US,"Full berry cocoa and pepper aromas on the nose open to solid black cherry and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is big, but there's fairly high acidity, too, and some big tannins with a decided bite on the back end.  The elements are there in this dense and chunky wine; only time will tell if they come into greater harmony.",,85,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"From a blazingly hot harvest comes this wine, with baked fruit flavors and a Porty sweetness to the finish. It shows that not every vintage in California is perfect for every variety.",,82,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Valley of the Moon

US,"Simple and fruity and forward, though still unbalanced from extreme youth. It's more like a Beaujolais nouveau, with an odd, disjointed, watery finish. The price seems way out of line for what's in the bottle.",Sin Zin,82,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"Now in its third vintage, this complex Bordeaux blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, performs at the height of Sebastiani's red portfolio. Mainly from great vineyards in Alexander and Sonoma valleys, it's very much in the modern style, soft and ripe. Yet it maintains an elegant dignity, and it passes the threepeat test: You want a second glass, and then a third.",Secolo Red Wine,92,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sebastiani
US,"This wine become pretty pricey but that's because consumers recognize its quality; its sheer deliciousness can't be beat. It has all the elements of fine Russian River Pinot—it's dry and has lots o f ripe fruit, pretty oak, toast and spice—and it puts them all together in a super-elegant package. The vintage is light but the wine doesn't seem to mind. Its class shows. `",Thomas Road Vineyard,90,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef.",Meritage,90,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"This ripe, lovely wine shows classic Russian River Valley aromas of ripe, sweet, green apples. The winemaking adds smoky, vanilla-scented oak, a creamy, leesy smoothness and a rich softness that owes to malolactic fermentation. What strikes you, though, is the balance. All the parts come together in this super-enjoyable wine. At this price, it's a great value.",,89,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood
US,"Here's a Pinot Blanc that's not a Chardonnay lookalike, with its melange of wildflower and tropical fruit aromas. There's something almost Rhône-like in the opulence of its flavors, with chocolate, honey, brown-crushed spice and nectarines in a crisp wine with a long finish. It misses a few points because of a certain lack of complexity, but flavor freaks won't be disappointed by this jolting wine.",,88,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon

US,"Enough berry and plum richness and smoky oak to satisfy fussy drinkers, yet dry and compact, with a nice shine of acidity. Not too complex or subtle, but there's plenty to like about it. Should be easy to find with more than 30,000 cases produced.",,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"If you didn't know the price and had to guess, you'd probably figure this wine would cost about $18. It's enormously ripe and fruity, with bright peach, tropical fruits and spices and quite a bit of oak. The technical notes say it was partially barrel-fermented. A wine of enormous charm and a great value in Chardonnay.",,86,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dreyer Sonoma
US,"Not quite enough Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine to varietally label it, and kudos to the winemaker for blending in Merlot and Cab Franc, which increases complexity.

Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.",,85,21,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.",Reserve,84,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure.",Vintner Select Cuvée,94,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
US,"Aloof and tannic now. It's very dry, and those tannins lock in and cry out for something to melt them. It's best to decant this wine many hours in advance of drinking it, but it should develop well over the next eight to ten years.",Cinq Cepages,90,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Deeply colored and rather full-bodied for a rosé, this blush is dry and crisp, with potent, one-dimensional flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola.",Rosato di Sangiovese,84,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Valley of the Moon
US,"Too strong by half, lacking restraint and elegance. All you get is an explosion of superripe fruit and oak. Tastes like a berry, roasted nut and mocha candy bar.",Dunnsden,83,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merriam
US,"This is one of the few Cab Francs in California that works on its own. It's really a gorgeous wine, showing the full-bodied firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon, but without the tannic weight and density. The flavors veer toward scrumptious red cherries, red currants, milk chocolate and anise, with a dry, complex finish. Lovely with a fine grilled steak and rosemary new potatoes.",,93,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
US,"Viognier is nothing if it's not rich, and who knows richness better than Bob Foley? This wine is an exotic treasure trove of pineapple tart, pear jam, apricot purée, honeysuckle, butterscotch and dusty Asian spice flavors, balanced with crisp acids and a steely, minerally finish.",,93,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Pride Mountain
US,"This is a new winery for me, and it's a promising start. The wine is decadently rich in cassis, cherries, milk chocolate and vanilla flavors, but it has the structural integrity of a fine wine. While acidity is soft, the tannins have the grip of cherry skins, while oak adds its own tannic complexities.",Mountain Cuvee,88,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hans Fahden
US,"Simple and sweet, like a fruit juice blend of apples, peaches and pineapples you buy in the supermarket.",,82,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"This is from a vineyard high in the Mayacamas on the Sonoma side of Diamond Mountain. The wine was made by Marco DiGiulio, a well-known consulting winemaker in Napa Valley. It's a big, thick 100% mountain Cabernet, intense in cassis, dark chocolate and new oak, and an interesting hit of Provençal herbs. It's also high in alcohol and low in acidity, which may inhibit ageability.",,88,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge
US,"Dark and dramatically rich, with blackberry jam, cherry-pie filling, milk chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors, this polished wine has gorgeously fine tannins. It could use greater acidity for structure, though, because it's very soft and melted, which makes all that fruit taste sugary sweet.",Old Vine,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Yummy Chard, complex and delicious. Offers lots of ripe, rich peach and pineapple custard flavors, sweet, toasty oak and a buttery texture. Nice, perky acids keep things lively and clean.",Sonoma County Selection,89,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
US,"This is a yummy Cab, gentle in the mouth, insistent in flavor, and rich and balanced. There's a rich herb edge to the blackberry flavors, and the finish is dry, with a dusting of tannins that a good steak will cut right through.",,89,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now–2013.",Tresor,94,58,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano
US,"What's likeable about this wine is that it doesn't go for the cheap thrills of superripe fruit and form of oak flavoring so common in Chards of this price. What you get is a dry, minerally wine, with a firm spine and just enough peach and oak to make it rich and complex.",,88,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Showing the usual balance and harmony of this bottling, which is made from the five Bordeaux varieties, the '06 nonetheless lacks a bit of the richness of other vintages. It's beautifully clean and dry, with sound currant, blackberry, herb tea and cedar flavors, but is missing a certain fatness in the middle. Best now–2012.",Cinq Cépages,92,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Serious Cabernet, rich and complex and full bodied, made from Knights Valley and Alexander Valley fruit, with a few grapes from Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder. Dense and tannic now, but high toned, with waves of black currants, black cherries and oak. A good price for a Cabernet of this quality. Drink now–2012.",Grand Reserve,91,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Unusual for an inexpensive Cab of this age to hit the market, and it's a pretty good buy. Nothing complicated, but it's soft and smooth, and beginning to show that magical transformation when primary fruit develops bouquet and a dried fruit character.",,86,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prospero
US,"Good, everyday red for those who like their Zins briary, brambly and rustic. It's a soul food wine, whose berry-cherry flavors are just short of of raisiny. Not without its faults, but easy and gulpable.",,85,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bridgeway
US,"Easy and tasty, this is a nice everyday wine, with citrus, vanilla and grass flavors, a tangy bite of acid, and a dry, lemon-and-lime finish.",,85,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Simi
US,"Very soft, almost melted is the texture on this wine. Soft in both tannins and acids, which leaves the fruit and alcohol to star. The flavors, of blackberries, cherries, milk chocolate, plums and coffee, are rich, but the wine could use greater structure.",Lot 24,84,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Cameron Hughes
US,"These are supposedly old clones, hence the name. The wine is sharp in acidity and jammy, with pungent cherry-blackberry fruit that tastes like it's just out of the fermenting tank.",Heritage,84,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Tastes flat and simple, with fruit disappearing, although there's a ghost of blackberries that turns a little more intense on the finish. Consume now.",,83,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Prospero
US,"Lots of true Pinot character in this dry, elegant wine, which contains mainly Russian River fruit. Made for early drinking, it has complex cherry, root beer, pomegranate, herb tea and spice flavors, wrapped into a delicately silky texture.",,89,34,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Beautiful Sonoma Zin, sourced mainly from Alexander Valley. Although the winemaker had to struggle against shriveled, raisiny fruit, the wine shows a soft complexity. Ripe and forward in cherry-berry, tobacco, rum baba, coffee and crushed hard spices, it finishes long and dry.",Reserve,88,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
US,"Rustic in texture, with jagged tannins, this is an old-fashioned wine, the kind they drank straight out of the cellar a long time ago. Made from Zinfandel, Carignan and several other varieties, it's dry and tannic, with berry, currant and spice flavors.",Geyserville,86,37,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ridge

It's a natural choice for barbecue and meat stews.",The Sophisticate,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Four Vines

It's a little sweet, but the texture is very smooth, putting it in the league of more expensive sparkling wines.",Va de Vi Ultra Cuvée,87,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
US,"Kudos to Dry Creek for producing a wine this good and affordable. Made without oak, it features zesty acidity that brightens and boosts the Meyer lemon, lime, peach and vanilla flavors. Production was nearly 30,000 cases, making it easy to find.",,87,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Based on Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend is very ripe and forward in blueberry, cherry and raspberry jam, and it finishes in a swirl of dusty baking spices. It's a good wine, if a bit rustic, with some edgy tannins and high alcohol.",Bastille,86,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,De Novo
US,"This is a good, brisk Sauvignon Blanc whose citrus and tropical fruit, peach and vanilla flavors are delicious. Bright acidity makes it feel clean and zesty.",,87,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sebastiani
US,"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary. That extra bit of aging has mellowed the wine, giving it a creamy, buttery richness. It has good acidity, too, that gives a lift to the ripe tropical fruits.",,92,26,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"This is a soft and easy-to-drink Zinfandel. A blend of Dry Creek and Russian River fruit, it has ripe wild berry, mocha, licorice and pepper flavors, with a touch of sweet oak.",Sonoma County Selection,87,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gary Farrell

It's a good, elegant wine for drinking now.",,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Banshee Wines
US,"Soft, gentle and rich, this is made for drinking now with Cabernet-friendly foods.

US,"Ripe and flashy, this Cabernet is a bit rustic now. The vineyard is quite high up in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the flavors show that intense, mountain concentration of blackberries and cherries. Without history to refer to, it's hard to predict this wine's future, but you might consider cellaring it for 6–8 years to see what happens.",Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,89,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ispiri

US,"A little soft and herbal, in the way of certain Sonoma Cabernets, but incredibly rich, offering a heady array of flavors.

US,"Even by De Loach's standards of enormously ripe Zinfandels, this one stands out. It's a hydrogen bomb of a wine, fantastically rich in berries and fruits that have a slightly dried quality to them. The tannins are thick, and the alcohol seems higher and hotter than the stated 14.5% by volume.",Riebli Valley Vineyard,88,34,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"This is one of the best Bordeaux-style blends Wellington has ever produced. Although it still has plenty of life ahead, perhaps as much as 10 more years, its soft tannins and sweet black-currant flavor make it drinkable now.

Should be fine well past the year 2020.",La Joie,98,300,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Verité
US,"Extremely tannic at the age of five years, and that astringency accentuates the dryness, making the wine austere and distant.

The black cherry, plum, black currant, dark chocolate and licorice fruit is big, but perfectly balanced with smoky, sweet oak, while a subtle touch of violets brings a smack of the earth.

US,"Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease.

US,"For some reason, the winery held the '06 back later than the 2007. Maybe because it was so tannic. Still is, with a biting, palate-shutting astringency made harder by the wine's extreme dryness. But there's a place for tannic, dry Syrahs, and this is a very good one, with precisely measured oak framing deep, impressive blackberry, leather and black pepper flavors.",Three Coins Betsy's Vineyard,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Lawer

US,"This is delicious, right up there with a great Cabernet. First of all, there's the smoothly tannic and velvety mouthfeel. Then there's the flavors that are wildly attractive in blackberries, black licorice, crispy bacon and something purple and flowery, like violets.

US,"This wine was sent to me with little information about the owners, and their Web Site doesn't reveal much. The paperwork says it's from Knights Valley, although the label reads Sonoma County. It's a dry, fairly tannic wine, quite ripe in currants and dark chocolate, with an herbal edge and a firm structure.

US,"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.",Journey,93,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek

US,"Sugary sweet and simple, with flavors like a blend of the juices of pineapples, apples and pears. It's also soft, which makes it a little cloying.",Blue Ash Road,81,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Parkers Estate
US,"Acidic and minty, this Pinot has underripe green flavors that interfere with the enjoyment greater richness would provide. The thinness emphasizes the astringent tannins.",Sonoma Reserve,81,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blackstone

US,"This has intensely concentrated flavors of black currant, blueberry preserves, violet, vanilla and buttered toast; it's as delicious as any Cabernet out there. The structure shows firm tannins and fine acidity, true to its mountainous origins. Keep this in your cellar for at least six years, and as many as 20.",55% Slope Impassable Mountain Reserve,95,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge
US,"Bella's quartet of new 2009 Zinfandels is their best ever. This small-production wine, a best-of-barrels selection from their various vineyards, is softly tannic and silky, and its flavors of wild berry, currant, cola, spice and sandalwood should be enjoyed now. The mouthfeel is utterly luxurious, offering the best elements of a Napa Valley cult Cabernet, with the briary, rustically chic qualities of Zinfandel.",Barrel 32,94,48,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"Made from Syrah and Grenache, this blend shows the strengths and weaknesses of its style. While it's forwardly delicious and complex in cherry, licorice, bacon, black pepper, mocha and sandalwood flavors, it's rather soft.",Proprietor's Blend,86,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Rhône-style Red Blend,Cosa Obra
US,"Dry, spicy and elegantly structured, this is a little rugged around the edges in texture, but the black raspberry and cola flavors are savory.",Unhinged,86,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stomping Girl
US,"Intense sweetness goes a long way toward making this dessert wine delicious and satisfying. While it's a bit lacking in fruity concentration, it does have good blackberry and milk chocolate flavors.",Late Bottled Vintage,86,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Port,Valley of the Moon
US,"This bubbly is rich in cherry and raspberry fruit, in addition to the usual sparkling wine notes of bread dough and smoke. It's a little sweet and scoury on the palate, but a fairly polished sparkler for this price.",Sonoma Brut,86,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
US,"The dryness and minerality of this wine, combined with its clean, brisk elegance, make it a very nice partner for shellfish. The flavors are lemons, limes, and ripe, crisp white peaches.",,89,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"This has subtle flavors of strawberries, limes, dough and vanilla smoke. It's a little rough in the mouth, with a scoury texture, but it's a good buy at this price.",Select Cuvée Brut,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Piper Sonoma
US,"Soft in texture, this Zin has flavors of freshly crushed, ripe blackberries, cherries and raspberries, cocoa and black pepper, with a burnt brown-butter, baked pastry crust edge. It's pretty tannic, which makes it a good foil for rich meats and cheeses. Decant for an hour or two.",Old Vines,88,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wild Oak by St. Francis
US,"This Zin is so fresh and jammy in raspberries, cherries and blackberries, you wonder why they didn't hold it back for a while, to let the flavors meld. Tasted in March 2008, it still had that acid-forward, crushed berry tartness you find in wine straight out of the fermenter. But it's a very good Zin that will improve in the bottle. This should be at its best by this winter and into 2009.",Ponzo Vineyard,88,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hawley
US,"With cherry, cola, pomegranate, herb tea and smoky vanilla flavors, this Pinot is dry, silky and direct, offering immediate charm. At its best now.",,87,36,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vision Cellars
US,"There's value for the money in this smooth wine. It smacks of cherries, not the darker, deeper fruits of Syrah, but it does have a complex leathery, meaty edge. The tannin-acid balance is just right, and leads to a simple, fruity finish.",,86,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Valley of the Moon

US,"Spann is building a decent track record with their Chardonnay-Viognier blend. The wine is very ripe and attractive in tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, and while it's a little on the sweet side, the acidity pulls it back from the brink.",,86,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Viognier,Spann Vineyards
US,"The winery's grape sourcing in the past has been the Sierra Foothills. This Syrah hails from Sonoma Valley, and it has lost a bit of complexity in the translation. The wine is 100% Syrah, unlike last year's “The Brawler” bottling, which contained some Viognier. It's a little heavy and soft, although there's no denying the richness of the blackberry jam, coffee and chocolate flavors. Now–2013.",The Instigator,88,36,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Prospect 772
US,"This is bold and assertive, yet mellow. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the house style of soft approachability and complexity, offering tiers of blackberry, currant, sage, dried herb and smoky oak. Drink now–2015.",Cinq Cépages,92,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chateau St. Jean

US,"By calling it Fumé, instead of Sauvignon, Blanc, the winery telegraphs that the wine was aged in barrels. The wood has given a subtle, rich texture of smoky cream, while the yeast adds doughy notes to the citrus, fig and spice flavors.",,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Moon Mountain dropped the price on their basic Cab years ago, and with it, quality dipped. The concentration just isn't here. On the other hand, it's a nice, smooth, clean wine, with enough blackberry and currant varietal character to satisfy Cab lovers.",,85,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Exceptionally ripe and juicy, with briary wild-blackberry and cherry flavors. It's a good wine, a little coarse, but nicely dry and spicy. A brief decant will help soften the tannins.",,86,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chime
US,"Even for Zinfandel, this is a pretty big wine. It's just enormous in tannins and briary fruit, flooding the mouth with blackberries, black currants, anise, bacon, carob and pepper. It's also very high in alcohol, although it wears it well.",,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rock Wall
US,"This is a good Zinfandel with some special qualities. It's full-bodied and very ripe, with berry-cherry flavors that have a baked, pie-filling warmth, and additional layers of olive tapenade and salted, dried beef. The finish includes Zin's savory wealth of peppery spices.",,87,34,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Adobe Road
US,"Soft and ripe in extracted cherry and blackberry jam fruit, this also has some heat on the palate, the result of 15% alcohol. It feels a little simple, and the heat is off-putting.",Kreck Family Vineyards,84,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mill Creek
US,"Dry, creamy and crisp, with pleasant citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, this Chardonnay shows a lot of upscale character at a price under $20. Easy to find, with 200,000 cases produced.",,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Rich in oaky, fruity flavor, this wine satisfies with pineapples and other citrus fruits, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla. It's pretty direct, but the price is right for a clean, crisp Chard made in the popular style.",,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood
US,"A good Merlot for food. Although it's a bit gritty and sharp, it's dry and spicy, with a complex range of black cherry, blueberry, herb, violet and cedar flavors. Drink now.",,87,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Ferrari-Carano
US,"A rich, fruity Viognier that shows its sunny, warm origins in the ripe array of tropical fruits, wildflowers, honey, vanilla and spices, and also in the softness. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable, especially as a cocktail wine.",,87,23,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Hawley
US,"Smells and tastes super-oaky, with dominating notes of vanilla, clove, dill and caramel. Although there's a ton of cherry, chocolate and raspberry fruit, sweet vanilla and toast still is the main element. Maybe it's going through a dumb phase and simply needs time. Try again after 2011.",Vintner Select,87,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
US,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy. For some reason, the winery lowered the price considerably from the 2005, which was a much better wine.",55% Slope,87,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge

US,"Unusual for a 2003 Cab to be held back this long before release. Maybe they thought the tannins were too strong. They're fully resolved now, but the fruit has faded, leaving behind mild flavors of dried cherries, currants and herbs that finish very dry. It's an elegant wine, rather than a voluptuous one.",L Vineyard,86,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,D'Argenzio

US,"Here's a good bottle of Zinfandel. It's dry and full bodied, with rich, spicy flavors of berries, fruit liqueur, roasted coffee, dark chocolate and pepper. A little rustic around the edges, but a fine Zin for drinking now.",,87,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
US,"Quite a nice Sauvignon Blanc, although it could be a tad drier on the finish, as there's a jammy, fruit tart quality. Shows crisp acidity framing ripe lemon, lime, green apple, melon and spice flavors.",,87,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Matanzas Creek
US,"Simple, fruity and sweet tasting, this has chocolate-covered raisin and blueberry jam flavors.",,84,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Decoy
US,"Good, deep flavors in this dry Cabernet. They include well-developed blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and tobacco, with savory hints of licorice, black pepper and cinnamon toast, smeared with plum jam. The texture could be a little smoother, as it's somewhat gritty.",Glen Oaks Ranch,87,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clarbec
US,Pushes Zinfandel to the limit of balance. The alcohol is nearly 16%. The tannins are hard. The blackberry and currant flavors wander into raisins. Yet on the plus side is extreme dryness and a certain complexity and curiosity value.,Reserve,87,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rock Wall
US,"Strong in flavor, showing the ripeness and crispness of all Bjornstad's Chardonnays, with lemondrop, lime tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.

US,"Cherries are the name of the game here, from beginning to end. Red cherries, black cherries, cherry jam, cherry pie, cherry liqueur. The texture is smooth, and the finish is dry. This is a nice, fairly complex wine that will elevate a great cheeseburger.",Estate,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Grenache,Wellington
US,"Give this young Zin some time in the bottle. It's too jammy and thick to show its best now. With a rich core of blackberries, chocolate, leather, plums and spices that are wrapped into significant tannins, it should meld together by the middle of 2010.",,88,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ledson
US,"Great price for this unoaked white wine. It's smooth and crisp in mouthwatering acidity, with ripe flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, minerals and vanilla that finish with a honeyed richness. Easy to find, with production of 21,696 cases.",,87,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"While this Syrah is a bit angular now, it does offer great structure, with a fine architecture of tannin and acid.

It becomes more interesting as it warms in the glass.",,89,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy

Now–2012.",Mohrhardt Ridge,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington

US,"Greenwood Ridge does a terrific job with Scherrer's Alexander Valley Zin grapes, capturing the intensity of these century vines while maintaining balance.

Enjoy this potent wine now through 2014, before it loses its fruit.",Scherrer Vineyards,93,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Greenwood Ridge
US,"Give this dramatic young Pinot time to grow up. It's super-young in jammy cherry, raspberry, licorice, cola and smoky new oak flavors, and while the tannic-acid structure is first-rate, it's a little too unresolved for full enjoyment. Needs at least through the end of 2008 to come together. But should be magnificent, and capable of several years in the cellar.",Auction Block,93,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Huge flavors in this creamy wine, exploding in pineapples, limes, kiwi fruit and peaches, with a tangy edge of gooseberry. It's dry and acidic and clean. Tastes a little honey sweet, but the tartness balances.",Kick Ranch,86,21,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Carica
US,"A nice, smooth, rich Zinfandel that shows classic flavors at a fair price.

US,"This is a very rich wine, dense, soft and almost heavy. Comprised of Zinfandel, Carignane, Petite Sirah and other undisclosed varieties, its proprietary name refers to the kind of field-blended red wines made by the Italian-American settlers of old.

US,"A lovely Cabernet Franc, one of the best on the market. Shows classic Pride Mountain characteristics of ripeness, balance and immediate drinkability, although it will take a few years in the cellar.

US,"A fine Zin from some of Sonoma's best vineyards. Briary and rustic, it brims with dry, savory flavors of wild berries, cherries and spices, with a rich finish that goes on for a good 30 seconds.",,88,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"Higher in alcohol than Kenwood's regular '05 Sonoma Zin, this one's hotter and more full-bodied. It's got a density that can stand a little bottle age. Give it two or three years to soften, and let the blackberry, cherry and coffee fruit emerge from the tannins.",Reserve,88,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"Nice and crisp and silky in texture, but far too sweet for a table wine, with sugary flavors of raspberries and nougat, which is a sugary almond paste.",Pinot Noir,82,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Rosé,Adobe Road
US,"Nice and smooth, this Merlot is for early drinking. It's as plump as can be in cherries, cocoa, cola and tobacco, with soft acids and even softer tannins.",,85,23,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Simi
US,"Very dry and sharp, almost sour, with Lifesaver cherry flavors. Not going anywhere.",Reserve,80,65,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tara Bella
US,"Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.",Grand Reserve,90,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kendall-Jackson
US,"The first duty of a blush bubbly is to be delicious and elegant, and this one is, despite the full-bodied flavors from a majority of Pinot Noir. The wine is dry and complex, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, limes, buttery vanilla, yeast and smoky oak. Really good, and will develop through 2013.",Brut Rosé,93,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
US,"Couldn't be riper or more powerful in flavor, a Chard that just detonates with explosive pineapple tart filling, honey, vanilla and crème brûlée. Could use a bit of subtlety, but fans of pure Chardonnay flavor will be delighted.",Durell Vineyard,89,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"One of the best Sangiovese out there, mainly due to the ripe balance. Avoids the unripeness or excessive ripeness that can mar this variety in California.

The next step is to elevate this wine to complex greatness, especially at this price.",,90,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Pride Mountain
US,"Dry Creek's basic Zin is a dark, big, softly tannic wine, the kind beloved by Zinfanatics. The flavors of blackberries, boysenberries, loganberries and many other red and black berries flood the mouth, with a spicy finish of chocolate and caramel.",Heritage,88,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,This is really one of the least likeable Rosenblum wines I've ever tasted. It smells vegetal and is simple and soft in cherry and blackberry Lifesaver flavors that finish with a sugary sweetness.,House Family Vineyards,80,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.",,86,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Gloria Ferrer holds this vintage brut back for many years before release, to the consumer's benefit. The '02 is rich and complex and beautiful now, although it has years remaining to its useful life. Shows flavors of limes, raspberries, brioche, tangerine zest, vanilla, yeasty bread dough and honeysuckle. An elegant, dry bubbly of enormous charm.",Royal Cuvée,93,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
US,"They kept this Cab back all this time, presumably at some cost to the company, but consumers are the beneficiaries. Everything has mellowed. The wine, with 1% Petit Verdot, is like hands of cassis, dark chocolate and oak massaging the palate. The grapes were sourced from top vineyards in the Dry Creek, Sonoma and Alexander Valleys. Drink now–2010.",,93,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"It's hard to find a Pinot at this price that shows real sophistication, but Stephen Vincent tries hard. The wine is racy and silky, with coastal elegance. Its cherry, licorice and cola flavors have a little kiss of oak.",,85,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stephen Vincent
US,"Blackstone's been working hard on their Pinot, and with this new Sonoma Reserve line, they've produced their best ever. It's a rich, dry wine that seems to have both cool- and warm-climate notes. Shows cherry pie, cola, blackberry tart and spice flavors, although it's a bit on the soft side.",Sonoma Reserve,88,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blackstone
US,"A blend of Zin, Merlot, Syrah, Carignan and several others, this is the anti-Napa red wine.

US,"They say the vines average 80 years of age, which means who knows where those old roots have explored. For that matter, who knows what the grape varieties really are. The wine is the least fruity of the winery's current Zins. While it shows berry-cherry and licorice flavors, it's notable for hard-to-describe earthy, mineral and mushroomy tastes that are interesting and unique.",Old Vine,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"A beautiful Cabernet, made in an elegantly approachable way. Dry and smooth, it shows complex flavors of blackberries, currants and dried herbs, wrapped into rich, dusty tannins. The alcohol level is quite high, but balanced, in a California way.",,92,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood

At this enormous production level—nearly a quarter-million cases—this is a tremendous achievement.",,90,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Fresh tropical fruit, peach and apricot flavors star in this flashy young wine. Oak also plays a prominent role, giving buttered toast and caramel notes. And the texture is creamy and smooth. The overall impression is very rich and powerful, but the wine could have more finesse. Drink now.",Journey,89,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"It has been some years since I last tasted this proprietary Bordeaux blend, and it's nice to see it's a very good wine. A little hard and unresolved now, it shows a wealth of oak-infused blackberry, cherry, olive and cocoa flavors, and an acid-tannin balance that will help it age. Best 2008–2010 or so.",Trésor,90,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano

US,"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine. Blending from a vast source of vineyards has given winemaker Cabral the ability to fill in divots of every kind.

US,"Lots of flash in this relatively inexpensive Chardonnay, which shares many of the qualities of far more expensive wines.

US,"As much as I like this Merlot, it feels like they let it get too ripe and gave it too much oak. It was a great vintage, and the grapes ripened effortlessly. Yet there's a baked fruit, toothpicky oakiness that robs the wine of elegance.",,86,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood

Now through 2010 for freshness.",,88,27,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Shows the impeccable balance you expect from this master winemaker, even in this hot vintage, where supermaturity was a challenge. The wine is certainly ripe, offering a mouthful of blackberries, cherries and currants. But it never loses its elegant tannin-acid architecture. Beautiful now, and should develop through 2014.",,93,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood

US,"I like the light-bodied texture, acidity and delicate mouthfeel of this wine, with its pretty lemonade, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. But the finish is too sugary-sweet.",,83,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"Still pretty tannic at nearly four years of age, this Merlot is also very dry, and it has a tart acidity. Structurally, it's a rustic wine, whose cherry-blackberry flavors have a weedy, minty, herbal edge.",,83,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Sonoma Vineyards

Cola and cherry flavors finish clean and fresh.",Reserve,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,"Kent Rosenblum readily concedes some of his reds have residual sugar, and I'm certain this one does.

Nice acidity and a tangy-spicy finish.",Kent Ritchie Vineyard,89,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Scott Paul
US,"Nice sweet-tart flavors and a medium mouthfeel make this is one of our most-enjoyed California renditions of Tuscany's workhorse red. The tart black cherry, leather and slight mineral notes are on target, the finish smooth and delicious.",,89,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Lovely aromas, flavors and a fine mouthfeel define this rare item—a real Pinot Noir value. Appealing black cherry, earth, and tarragon aromas and flavors keep the taster interested, suggesting a broad range of food pairings, from salmon to lamb. It even offers decent body and length, almost unheard of in this price range.",,88,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.",Whitney's Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fisher
US,"The wine is 100% Cabernet, sourced from a vineyard in the Mayacamas. It's very tannic and dry at this point. Such is the massive fruit core, of cassis and cherries, and the overall balance, that the wine must age well, even though it has no history of doing so. Hold until 2010 and try again.",Brigden Vineyard,93,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Owl Ridge
US,"Soft, simple and sweetish, this Pinot has cherry pie filling, cola and rhubarb pie flavors. It contains a dollop of Petite Sirah, which gives it more body.",,83,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Creek
US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind. This full-bodied, nicely textured Chardonnay has nutty, smoky and spicy flavors melding with tangy tropical fruit to create a tasty, fairly lush wine that's easy to enjoy. Finishes soft, with a faint whiff of petrol—in the Alsace manner—and is drinking well now.",David Selby Reserve,88,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Selby
US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas. More candy apple-like flavors appear in the mouth, accompanied by tropical fruit and toasty accents with a rich caramel tone. It verges on too-sweet, but it's nonetheless pleasing in an uncomplicated way.",,87,33,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.",Sangiacomo Vineyards Reserve,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bernardus
US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors. Mouthfeel is dry and briskly acid—but with a nice chalky note, too. Chalk shows again on the finish, where it somewhat checks the sharp lemony-metallic notes.",Seascape Vineyard,87,46,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness. It's slightly hot, with dominant butterscotch and vanillin oaky flavors.",Upper Barn,87,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"This is a brisk, clean wine, marked by tart acidity that scours the palate and prepares it for food. The followup flavors are of spicy tropical citrus fruits and green, savory gooseberries. The grapes are from a coolish vineyard near Santa Rosa.",Kick Ranch,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Enkidu
US,"Not quite in the league as the winery's more expensive Syrahs, but at about half the price, it's a comparative bargain. With a rich, velvety texture and smooth, ripe tannins, the wine features oak-influenced flavors of blackberries, cherries raspberries and milk chocolate.",,88,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Now in its third vintage, this complex Bordeaux blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, performs at the height of Sebastiani's red portfolio. Mainly from great vineyards in Alexander and Sonoma valleys, it's very much in the modern style, soft and ripe. Yet it maintains an elegant dignity, and it passes the threepeat test: You want a second glass, and then a third.",Secolo Red Wine,92,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sebastiani
US,"A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.",Barelli Creek Vineyard,86,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Barbera,E & J Gallo
US,"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.",Reserve,96,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
US,"The '03 is elegant and sleek, with blackberry and cassis flavors that finish thoroughly dry. But even at 4-plus years, the tannins are very harsh. Could surprise in a decade, but it's a gamble.",Artist Series,87,70,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"This top-of-the-line Cab surely must be one of the last 2001s to be released. It's an exquisite wine. New oak dominates, with caramelized vanilla and char. But it's appropriate given the size of the fruit. The black currant, Hoison sauce, crème de cassis, milk chocolate and licorice flavors are completely satisfying. Best now and for the next ten years.",Reserve,93,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"There can't be too many 2001 Merlots waiting to be released, and St. Jean must have waited to let the tannins soften. They have. Still a bit hard, the wine drinks beautifully now, with lush cherry, cocoa, spice and lavender flavors. The oak is 100% new French, and it works. Drink with the best steak you can find.",Reserve,93,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Chateau St. Jean
US,"This may be the most expensive Malbec in California, but it's a really good wine that is full-bodied and deeply flavored. Like a great Cabernet, it shows polished black currant, spicy plum and new-oak flavors, with wonderfully rich, sweet tannins and soft acids. So easy to drink, so delicious now, but you might try cellaring it through 2010.",Reserve,92,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Malbec,Chateau St. Jean
US,"This Bordeaux blend is showing its youth with a rawly acidic scour that frames jammy, fairly sweet cherry and cassis flavors, and feels disjointed. But it may just need some time in the bottle. Try after 2008. No guarantees.",Milestone Red Wine,86,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pellegrini
US,"As in previous vintages, the 2005 is bone dry, high in acidity, and New Zealandy in its mineral, gooseberry and citrus flavors. This streamlined Sauvignon is one of the cleaner ones around. A beautiful companion for all sorts of foods.",Redwood Ranch,90,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Gary Farrell
US,"Rough in texture, with jagged tannins and a dry, rasping finish. This blend of the two Cabernets, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah is rustic, with fruity, berry jam, currant and cedar flavors.",Director's Cut Cinema,84,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Francis Ford Coppola
US,"A bit piquant, as if the blackberry and currant flavor is just beginning to enter a new phase in which older, dried fruit character emerges. It's an interesting phase, too, intermixed as it is with plenty of toasty, newish oak. This is a wine that could do interesting things over the next five years.",Reserve,88,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"A little hot and raisiny, with dessicated blackberry and cherry flavors that accentuate the tannins, making them harder and more astringent than they really are.",Sonoma Reserve,84,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,"Here's a high-acid, minerally Chard, that's clean in citrus zest, pink grapefruit and richer peach and pear flavors. With a touch of smoky oak, it's balanced elegance.",Scherrer Vineyard,88,26,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Scherrer
US,"Very black in color with massive black currant flavors and very high alcohol. It's certainly a brawny Zin, and it hardly needs the added Petite Sirah, which makes it even more muscular and youthfully aggressive. But it's a good, sound wine that should age for decades.",,88,26,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Marr
US,"Previous vintages seemed a lot more ripe and forgiving than this one. The wine tastes very dry and sparse, struggling to suggest cherries or blackberries. Because of the thinness, the alcohol stands out.",Sonoma Reserve,83,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,Plays it right down the middle. A good quality Cab at a fair price. Shows a rich tannic-acid structure and ripe fruit that has an earthy mushroom and soy edge. Drinking well now and for the next several years.,,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Harsh, hot and not very fruity, with dry, rasping tannins. Lacking in generosity.",,80,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Olson Ogden
US,"A fine, copper- colored blush with intricate flavors of raspberries, rosehip tea, peach and cinnamon spice. Goes beyond simple rosé-ness to achieve complexity.",Vin Gris Dry Rose Wine,87,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Rosé,Scherrer
US,"Immediately likeable for its direct, ripe flavors of candied peaches, kiwis, limes and pineapples. It has just the right acidity and a creamy texture.",Chalk Hill,86,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Varietally pure and true. This is a crisp, elegantly structured wine with tropical fruit flavors, honeysuckle, vanilla and masses of dusty crushed brown spices. Finishes really powerful in fruit.",,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Valley of the Moon hasn't raised the price on this Bordeaux blend for years, which makes it a value for the complexity you get. This isn't one of those soft, mushy wines that's all flavor and no structure. Acids and tannins provide the architecture for polished blackberry, black olive and smoky oak flavors that are so appealing.",Cuvée de la Luna,92,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Valley of the Moon
US,"A tremendous Zinfandel. Combines sheer volume of power fruit with finesse to essentially define the variety. With rich acidity and some firm, chewy tannins, it's brilliantly dry, displaying blackberry tart, black currant, cola, mocha, bacon and pepper flavors, dusted with savory Indian spices. A very great Zinfandel whose high alcohol is simply part of the wine's personality.",Riebli Valley Vineyard,94,48,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
US,"The tannins are so rich, and the acidity so fine, that this Zin gets extra points. It's fantastically ripe in flavors, with a spectrum of red and black cherries, cassis, black raspberries, anisette, tangerines, cocoa and dusty spices. Delicious.",The Sophisticate,91,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Four Vines
US,"Ripe and juicy, with intense blackberry jam and mocha flavors, this smoothly textured wine has rich tannins, perhaps from a majority of Dry Creek Valley grapes. With some sweetness on the finish, it's ready to drink now.",Kreck Family Vineyards,85,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mill Creek
US,"Here's a Merlot that's a little everyday, a little fancy. It has a velvety texture and currant, plum and oaky flavors. The downside is astringent tannins—the puckery kind that make the tongue stick to the roof of the mouth.",Healdsburg Ranches,85,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Belvedere
US,"Here's a clean, dry, elegant wine showing quite a bit of creamy, smoky oak and sophisticated peach, kiwi and apricot flavors. The Chard dominates. Viognier seems to bring acidic lift and a floral note.",,85,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Viognier,Spann Vineyards
US,"I have not been a great fan of this winery's Bordeaux reds, and this one also has a countrified thing going on, despite some very ripe and lip-smacking cherry flavors. Half the oak barrels it was aged in were new.",Rockpile Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Paradise Ridge
US,"There's just enough of a touch of green gooseberry and lemongrass to give this wine a piquant bite, both aromatically and in the mouth. Then, it turns rich in figgy pineapple and honeysuckle flavors, with crisp, stimulating acids. But that peppery bite returns refreshingly on the finish.",Reserve,90,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"Paradise Ridge has struggled with Cab, and continues to. This one's ripe and juicy in Cabernet fruit, but has a stubborn rusticity and jagged mouthfeel it can't quite overcome. It's a good Cab, but I think this vineyard is simply better for Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",Rockpile Vineyard,84,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paradise Ranch
US,"Feels young and gritty in the mouth, with astringent tannins and a core of cherry-berry fruit. This wine is seriously in need of decanting, but it doesn't seem like an ager.",Ladi's Vineyard,84,27,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paradise Ridge
US,"Okay everyday Chard, with toned-down peach, pear and oak flavors and a creaminess to the texture. Finishes dry, crisp and short.",Healdsburg Ranches,84,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Belvedere
US,"This is one of those fresh, young rosés that's sharp in juicy acidity, primary fruit and grapey flavors of cherries and raspberries. It's nice, with nuances of vanilla and cinnamon spice.",Rosato di,84,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Valley of the Moon
US,"This is quite a hefty young Chard. It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids. The peach, tropical fruit, pear, candied ginger and charry oak flavors have an acidic scour. Drink now and for the next 5 years.",Vintner Select Cuvée,89,47,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pride Mountain
US,"Easy and simple, with pleasant peach pie, citrus, mango, spiced pear and vanilla flavors that finish a little sweet and soft.",,83,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Riesling,Chateau St. Jean

US,"The primary source of this Zin is from Dry Creek Valley. It's rare to find this quality and quantity of upfront fruit in a Zin that's so balanced, but here it is. Massive raspberry, cherry, blackberry, mocha and Asian spice flavors, with buttery, smoky oak notes. Just delicious. Drink now.",Old Vine,93,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"The gigantic flavors are there, showing the exotic, flamboyant side of Viognier. Peach, pineapple, kiwi, Key lime pie, honeysuckle blossom, roasted almond, smoky new oak and Asian spices lead to a dry, honeyed finish. There's an edgy awkwardness, though, that limits elegance. Might simply be too young. Best after mid-2008.",,87,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Pride Mountain
US,"This is a Zin that needs a warmer vintage to really succeed, and 2005 was cool. It trades the richness of the ‘04 in favor of dried blackberry, tobacco, white pepper and herb flavors. The acid-tannin balance also is more notable. Quite good, but not great. Drink now.",Knotty Vines Estate,87,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
US,"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",Reserve,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"There's a sharpness to this wine that edges out the cherry and raspberry flavors. Although it's dry and rich in oak, that sharp prickly feeling emphasizes the tannins, and takes away from total enjoyment. Drink now.",,86,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
US,"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",Riverside Crossing,86,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Parkers Estate
US,"Pretty nice for a Chard of this everyday price. Made by 7-Eleven for sale in their stores, it's dry and creamy, with good varietal flavors of peaches, pears and apple butter, and is a good value.",,85,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Crest
US,"Pride's '05 Syrah is higher in alcohol than the past few vintages, and not to the wine's benefit. The wine tastes sweeter, hotter and mushier, despite the very ripe blackberry, raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. Drink now.",,85,57,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Pride Mountain
US,"With polished blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this affordable Cab represents a good value. It's soft, dry and stylish, and easy to drink.",,85,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sonoma Crest
US,"Soft and gentle, this is a Merlot to sip with steaks and chops and not worry about the price. It actually has more polish and richness than most ten dollar Merlots. The blackberry and cherry flavors finish with a rich coat of tannins.",,85,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Sonoma Crest
US,"This is the kind of Merlot that appeals to so many diners who are looking for a dry, fairly sophisticated red wine whose cost won't break the bank. Soft and silky, it has herb-infused cherry and smoky oak flavors.",,85,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"Finishes a little sweet, soft and simple, but the cherry and cola flavors have a richness that satisfies. Drink now.",,84,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Solidly in the winery's house style, this is a clean, varietally true Chard, dry and balanced. It shows citrus, green apple and mineral flavors, while partial barrel fermentation adds elements of smoky cream and buttered toast.",,84,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Full-bodied and robust, this has the tannicly rustic nature of an old-fashioned red. It is completely dry, with earthy flavors of dark stone fruits, currants, coffee, licorice, herbs and pepper.",,84,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Q
US,"Tough, dry and severely tannic, this Sonoma Cab shows modest berry, coffee and oak flavors. Give it a little decanting to let it mellow, but it's not an ager.",,83,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Q
US,"Hot and awkward, with jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives this wine an unbalanced, chili pepper burn.",Vintner Select Cuvée,82,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
US,"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",,82,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Pride Mountain
US,"This bubbly charms with cherry and raspberry flavors and a touch of limes and vanilla. It's nice and smooth in the mouth, with a creamy mousse. Showing real finesse and elegance, this sparkler will be delicious with raw tuna.",Blanc de Noirs,91,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",Reserve,91,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"Softly tannic, this Cab is full-bodied and has some complexity. The black cassis and cherry flavors have layers of spice and smoky oak, with a fine, sweet finish that lingers. Drink now through 2010.",,88,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
US,"Try sneaking this into your next wine group blind tasting. It might turn some heads. It shows the ripe, polished cherry, plum, sage, carob and licorice flavors of the finest Merlots, with rich, finely ground tannins, and finishes dry. With a drop of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, it has true complexity.",,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Ray's Station Vineyards
US,"At five years, the wine still retains some charm, but is showing its age. It's   a little tired in structure, and the fruit is fading, turning dry and leathery. But there's cherries and cassis, with some complexity in the finish. Drink now.",Claret,87,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,St. Francis
US,"A Merlot with real elegance. This is fully dry, with firm, furry tannins, showing black cherry and currant flavors that are transforming into dried fruits and sweet leather. Could develop for a few more years.",,87,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,St. Francis
US,"A beautiful Bordeaux blend, soft and intricately detailed, with something for everyone.

US,"This is a vigorous young Merlot, hard-wired with chunky, raw tannins. It offers a huge burst of fruit, with currant, cassis and chocolate flavors enriched by smoky oak. Not an ager, though, so drink now through 2010.",,88,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Huntington

US,"There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure.",Vintner Select Cuvée,94,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
US,"A very fine Cabernet that combines the modern cult style of ripeness with old-fashioned structure to produce a wine of exceptional appeal. It's rich in mountain-intense black currants, bitter chocolate, spices and smoky oak, wrapped into splendid tannins, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The grapes are from the Sonoma side of Spring Mountain, and the winemaker was veteran Marco DiGiulio. Now–2013.",55% Slope,95,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge
US,"This is one of the few Cab Francs in California that works on its own. It's really a gorgeous wine, showing the full-bodied firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon, but without the tannic weight and density. The flavors veer toward scrumptious red cherries, red currants, milk chocolate and anise, with a dry, complex finish. Lovely with a fine grilled steak and rosemary new potatoes.",,93,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
US,"Viognier is nothing if it's not rich, and who knows richness better than Bob Foley?

US,"Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.",Grand Reserve,90,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kendall-Jackson
US,"A good, sound wine, but far from a success for the Artist Series. In fact it shows rustic tannins and the slightly sweet softness you might find in, say, a Paso Robles Cab. Disappointing.",Artist Series,85,69,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood

US,"One of the best Sangiovese out there, mainly due to the ripe balance. Avoids the unripeness or excessive ripeness that can mar this variety in California. Shows lovely, rich black cherry, raspberry and cocoa flavors, enhanced with sweet oak. The next step is to elevate this wine to complex greatness, especially at this price.",,90,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Pride Mountain

US,"A tremendous Zinfandel. Combines sheer volume of power fruit with finesse to essentially define the variety. With rich acidity and some firm, chewy tannins, it's brilliantly dry, displaying blackberry tart, black currant, cola, mocha, bacon and pepper flavors, dusted with savory Indian spices. A very great Zinfandel whose high alcohol is simply part of the wine's personality.",Riebli Valley Vineyard,94,48,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach

US,"A good buy, compared to Roessler's more expensive bottlings. It's a county-wide blend, and quite a nice one.

Drink now.",Red Label,90,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
US,"A beautiful Cabernet for drinking now and over the next few years. It's dry and fine, with appealing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors all the way through the finish.

US,"This multivineyard blend is from Sonoma Valley and Dry Creek Valley. You really don't want to open it yet because it's too young. But it has a great future ahead, to judge from the rich, softly fine tannins and cherry, red currant, cola, olive tapenade and sweet fresh herb flavors. Balanced and refined, this Cab defines the Sonoma style. Best 2008–2015.",Reserve Speciale,93,100,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood

US,"Acidic and minty, this Pinot has underripe green flavors that interfere with the enjoyment greater richness would provide. The thinness emphasizes the astringent tannins.",Sonoma Reserve,81,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blackstone
US,"A very rich Syrah, in the Pride style. If it's not particularly complex or subtle, it more than makes up for it with massive fruit and sheer muscle power. Floods the mouth with ultraripe, briary blackberries, cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha and plenty of black pepper and Indian spice.",,90,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Pride Mountain
US,"For some reason, the winery held the '06 back later than the 2007. Maybe because it was so tannic. Still is, with a biting, palate-shutting astringency made harder by the wine's extreme dryness. But there's a place for tannic, dry Syrahs, and this is a very good one, with precisely measured oak framing deep, impressive blackberry, leather and black pepper flavors.",Three Coins Betsy's Vineyard,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Lawer

US,"This Merlot over-delivers for the everyday price.

US,"Dry and herbal, with tobacco, thyme and cedar flavors, and an island of wild blackberries floating in the middle. The considerable tannins make the wine astringent. Probably at its best for the next few years.",,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Deerfield
US,"Give this young Zin some time in the bottle. It's too jammy and thick to show its best now.

Good with spicy beef, pork and veal dishes.",Lola,87,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Stave 28
US,"Smells and tastes super-oaky, with dominating notes of vanilla, clove, dill and caramel. Although there's a ton of cherry, chocolate and raspberry fruit, sweet vanilla and toast still is the main element. Maybe it's going through a dumb phase and simply needs time. Try again after 2011.",Vintner Select,87,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
US,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy.

US,"This wine was sent to me with little information about the owners, and their Web Site doesn't reveal much. The paperwork says it's from Knights Valley, although the label reads Sonoma County. It's a dry, fairly tannic wine, quite ripe in currants and dark chocolate, with an herbal edge and a firm structure. Aged in 100% new French oak, it impresses for its richness and depth, and could develop over the next 6–8 years.",,92,55,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Huge Bear

US,"The vineyard is up in the Mayacamas between Spring Mountain and Sonoma Valley, and the wine shows quite a bit of power. Coming from this hot vintage, it's also very ripe and fruity, in a California way. But it's classically structured and dry, and the tannins are softly complex.

It drinks well now, with a round, soft full-bodiedness.",,91,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Matrix
US,"Harsh and dry, this Merlot has bitter cherry flavors with an edge of green unripeness. As a result the acidity is sharp.",,81,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Sebastiani
US,"A jammy, peppery Syrah, with sharp flavors of blackberries and considerable tannins. It's a rustic wine that needs rich meats and cheeses to tame it.",Cuvée,84,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Shiraz,Deerfield Ranch
US,"The tannins are so rich, and the acidity so fine, that this Zin gets extra points. It's fantastically ripe in flavors, with a spectrum of red and black cherries, cassis, black raspberries, anisette, tangerines, cocoa and dusty spices. Delicious.",The Sophisticate,91,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Four Vines
US,"Quite a good Merlot that's made in the Kenwood style, which is drily elegant rather than opulent. Shows class and finesse in the tobacco-edged flavors of cherries and blackberries, subtlely tinged with oak. Ready now.",Reserve,90,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"A bit harsh and rustic in the mouth, with a hot pepper and sandpaper roughness that detracts. Needs rich beef dishes to balance out its tannins.",Mario's Gran Rojo,84,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Esterlina
US,"Sweet, fruity and oaky, this Chard has flavors of peaches, pineapples and smoky vanilla.",,82,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kirkland Signature
US,"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise. Shows modest peach and pear flavors, with lots of caramelly, toasty oak.",,82,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
US,"Nice everyday Merlot. The cassis, cherry liqueur and blueberry flavors are finished with smoky oak, and it is totally dry and balanced in smooth tannins and brisk coastal acidity. Drink now.",,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Chateau St. Jean
US,"The perfect restaurant by-the-glass wine, and not only because it's relatively affordable by today's Pinot standards. Crisp, light-bodied and elegant, it's totally dry, with a pleasant array of ripe cherry, cherryskin, raspberry, cola and dusty spice flavors. Easy to find, with almost 20,000 cases produced.",,87,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Chateau St. Jean

US,"Too strong by half, lacking restraint and elegance. All you get is an explosion of superripe fruit and oak. Tastes like a berry, roasted nut and mocha candy bar.",Dunnsden,83,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merriam
US,"There's just enough of a touch of green gooseberry and lemongrass to give this wine a piquant bite, both aromatically and in the mouth. Then, it turns rich in figgy pineapple and honeysuckle flavors, with crisp, stimulating acids. But that peppery bite returns refreshingly on the finish.",Reserve,90,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"Tastes like orange, apricot and cherry sweet-and-sour sauce you get in a Chinese restaurant over pork or chicken. The flavors are of those fruits, with some white sugar and rice vinegar.",Mo Zin,80,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Spann Vineyards
US,"Sweeter than in the past, this blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cab Franc has overtly sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling that are not appropriate in a table wine.",Twenty-Three Barrels Mo Jo,80,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Spann Vineyards
US,"Enjoyable for its smooth, creamy texture, and the way the ripe fruit plays off against the oak, acids and tannins. Shows slightly sweet chocolate truffle primary flavor, with a follow-up of wild blackberry and cola. One of the more versatile, Merlot-like Zins out there.",,85,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood

Easy to like for its balanced flavors of blackberries and black currants, with gentle influences of oak. Pretty good price for a wine of polish and sophistication.",,89,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Couldn't be riper or more powerful in flavor, a Chard that just detonates with explosive pineapple tart filling, honey, vanilla and crème brûlée. Could use a bit of subtlety, but fans of pure Chardonnay flavor will be delighted.",Durell Vineyard,89,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
US,"Fruity-sweet and very full-bodied, with powerful, jammy cherry and spice flavors, edged with baked brown sugar. A little too brawny, even for Zin.",Sonoma Heritage Vines,83,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco

US,"Very dry and sharp, almost sour, with Lifesaver cherry flavors. Not going anywhere.",Reserve,80,65,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tara Bella
US,"Greenwood Ridge does a terrific job with Scherrer's Alexander Valley Zin grapes, capturing the intensity of these century vines while maintaining balance. The flavors are powerful, of wild summer red, blue and black berries, crushed pepper, Asian spices, crème de cassis, licorice and cola. Enjoy this potent wine now through 2014, before it loses its fruit.",Scherrer Vineyards,93,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Greenwood Ridge
US,"Give this dramatic young Pinot time to grow up. It's super-young in jammy cherry, raspberry, licorice, cola and smoky new oak flavors, and while the tannic-acid structure is first-rate, it's a little too unresolved for full enjoyment. Needs at least through the end of 2008 to come together. But should be magnificent, and capable of several years in the cellar.",Auction Block,93,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"This is quite a hefty young Chard. It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids. The peach, tropical fruit, pear, candied ginger and charry oak flavors have an acidic scour. Drink now and for the next 5 years.",Vintner Select Cuvée,89,47,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pride Mountain
US,"This is a very good, somewhat complex Sonoma County blend. It's soft and dry, with upfront, accessible berry, cherry, herb and oak flavors, and smooth tannins. Balanced and restrained, it's a nice partner for steak. Drink now.",,88,34,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bonneau
US,"This tannic wine is quintessential North Coast Petite Sirah. The vineyard is where Russian River Valley meets Dry Creek Valley, and the wine is bone dry and astringent. The superextracted cherry and blackberry flavors veer on liqueur, but happily avoid raisins, while cool Sonoma gives the wine an acidic brace. If you like these lusty young reds, you'll happily gulp it down with greasy barbecue and roasts.",Ponzo Vineyard,88,26,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Hawley
US,"Very rich in blackberries and cassis, with an herbal grounding of sage and tobacco and a dusting of freshly crushed black pepper. You'll find hard-edged tannins and some sharpness to the mouthfeel. A few years of aging are warranted, but this isn't a wine for the long haul. Decant if you drink it now.",,89,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mauritson
US,"Rodney Strong has vineyards across the county, from cool to warm, and winemaker Rick Sayre is a master blender. This is a terrific wine at this price. It's rich and opulent in blackberry, cassis, cocoa and sweet oak, with ripe tannins and a beautiful balance. At this enormous production level—nearly a quarter-million cases—this is a tremendous achievement.",,90,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Napa-based Fisher has a new Chardonnay vineyard in Sonoma, 1,300 feet up, and these Dijon clones have produced an intense wine. The grapes were picked very ripe, and the wine is huge in pear and crème brûlée flavors, with zesty acidity. Impressive for its size and interest. You keep reaching for another glass.",Mountain Estate Vineyard,92,56,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fisher
US,"This is what Valley of the Moon does so well—make a varietally true wine with some complexity, and offer it at a mid-priced range.

US,"This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now–2013.",Tresor,94,58,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Blackstone's been working hard on their Pinot, and with this new Sonoma Reserve line, they've produced their best ever. It's a rich, dry wine that seems to have both cool- and warm-climate notes. Shows cherry pie, cola, blackberry tart and spice flavors, although it's a bit on the soft side.",Sonoma Reserve,88,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Blackstone
US,"A blend of Zin, Merlot, Syrah, Carignan and several others, this is the anti-Napa red wine. It has an austerity, acidity and dryness that will elegantly show off complex food without dominating it. A very nice effort from Pellegrini.",Cuvée 107,88,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Pellegrini
US,"Although this is pretty tannic, with a sandpapery grip that finishes with astringency, it's fancy and layered. Waves of blackberries, cassis, coffee, cherries, leather and pepper-cinnamon spices wash over the palate, leaving the impression of importance. Still, it's not an ager. Best now and for a couple of years.",,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Wild Oak by St. Francis
US,"Showing the usual balance and harmony of this bottling, which is made from the five Bordeaux varieties, the '06 nonetheless lacks a bit of the richness of other vintages. It's beautifully clean and dry, with sound currant, blackberry, herb tea and cedar flavors, but is missing a certain fatness in the middle. Best now–2012.",Cinq Cépages,92,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"This is a really nice Chardonnay. Sebastiani knows how to make a balanced varietal wine, and this clean, ripe Chardonnay completely satisfies, with fruity flavors and a rich balance of creamy oak, coastal acidity and spicy oak.",,88,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
US,"Balanced and elegant, yet with all the briary, wild character of Zin, this wine, a blend of Russian River and Alexander Valley, captures the spirit of Sonoma Zin. It's nice and dry and balanced, with polished blackberry, blueberry, mocha and spice flavors.",Knotty Vines,90,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
US,"A delicious Pinot, but not particularly complex. With direct, primary cherry marmalade and jellied mint flavors, accented with a bit of oak, it's dry and crisp. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Lots of rich, ripe, forward fruit in this well-oaked wine, with tart green apple, pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors. It's stylishly dry, with a nice, creamy finish.",Sonoma Reserve,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Blackstone
US,"Lots of flash in this relatively inexpensive Chardonnay, which shares many of the qualities of far more expensive wines. Flamboyantly ripe tropical fruit, opulent oak with creamy buttered toast and vanilla, a rich, voluptuous texture, waves of complexity and crisp, balancing cool-climate acidity—it's all there.",,89,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Grand Archer
US,"The gigantic flavors are there, showing the exotic, flamboyant side of Viognier. Peach, pineapple, kiwi, Key lime pie, honeysuckle blossom, roasted almond, smoky new oak and Asian spices lead to a dry, honeyed finish. There's an edgy awkwardness, though, that limits elegance. Might simply be too young. Best after mid-2008.",,87,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Pride Mountain
US,"This is a Zin that needs a warmer vintage to really succeed, and 2005 was cool. It trades the richness of the ‘04 in favor of dried blackberry, tobacco, white pepper and herb flavors. The acid-tannin balance also is more notable. Quite good, but not great. Drink now.",Knotty Vines Estate,87,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
US,"They say the vines average 80 years of age, which means who knows where those old roots have explored. For that matter, who knows what the grape varieties really are. The wine is the least fruity of the winery's current Zins. While it shows berry-cherry and licorice flavors, it's notable for hard-to-describe earthy, mineral and mushroomy tastes that are interesting and unique.",Old Vine,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"With 10% Petite Sirah, which seems to give it a tannic essence of dark fruit intensity, this Zin is enormous in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with cola and caramel notes. It's full-bodied and dry and, once again, those tannins are center-stage.",Sonoma County Ranches,87,36,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Phipps
US,"Another success from Sebastiani. Dry and smooth, this has rich blackberry and oak flavors grounded in earthy tannins, and finishes dry and stylishly elegant. It could be your house Cab without breaking the bank.",,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"Serious Cabernet, rich and complex and full bodied, made from Knights Valley and Alexander Valley fruit, with a few grapes from Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder. Dense and tannic now, but high toned, with waves of black currants, black cherries and oak. A good price for a Cabernet of this quality. Drink now–2012.",Grand Reserve,91,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"With its creamy texture and opulent tangerine, lime zest, vanilla custard and spice flavors, this polished wine finishes with a cashew butter richness. Great acidity makes it bright and zingy. Very nice by itself or with a wide range of foods.",,88,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon
US,"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",Reserve,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"There's a sharpness to this wine that edges out the cherry and raspberry flavors. Although it's dry and rich in oak, that sharp prickly feeling emphasizes the tannins, and takes away from total enjoyment. Drink now.",,86,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
US,"Softly elegant and dry, this is a lovely Bordeaux blend to pair with a wide variety of meats and cheeses. Structure is the star, with grapeskin and oak barrel tannins framing delicate cherry, herb and earth flavors.",Sonoma Reserve Meritage,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackstone
US,"This 100%  Sauv is delicately structured and dry and crisp in acidity. While it has a touch of oak, the fruit has been allowed to star. Lemon, lime, green apple, fig, honeydew and vanilla all come together in this pure, fresh wine.",,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This is a nice, smooth and fairly sophisticated Merlot for immediate drinking. It's totally dry, with young tannins to cut through rich meats, and the cherry-blackberry fruit is balanced with an earthy, bitter coffee edge that gets the mouth watering.",Sonoma Reserve,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Blackstone

US,"Here's a solid Cabernet with extra features of complexity and interest. It's bone dry, with softly gentle tannins and rich, forward flavors of cherries, currants, herbs and cedar. Very pretty and polished, at a fair price.",,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"Pretty nice for a Chard of this everyday price. Made by 7-Eleven for sale in their stores, it's dry and creamy, with good varietal flavors of peaches, pears and apple butter, and is a good value.",,85,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma Crest
US,"As much as I like this Merlot, it feels like they let it get too ripe and gave it too much oak. It was a great vintage, and the grapes ripened effortlessly. Yet there's a baked fruit, toothpicky oakiness that robs the wine of elegance.",,86,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood
US,"Pride's '05 Syrah is higher in alcohol than the past few vintages, and not to the wine's benefit. The wine tastes sweeter, hotter and mushier, despite the very ripe blackberry, raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. Drink now.",,85,57,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Pride Mountain
US,"With polished blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this affordable Cab represents a good value. It's soft, dry and stylish, and easy to drink.",,85,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sonoma Crest
US,"Soft and gentle, this is a Merlot to sip with steaks and chops and not worry about the price. It actually has more polish and richness than most ten dollar Merlots. The blackberry and cherry flavors finish with a rich coat of tannins.",,85,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Sonoma Crest
US,"This is a gentle, easy Pinot for drinking tonight, yet it has something of the power and complexity of the winery's top bottlings. Which makes sense, given Williams Selyem's access to top grapes. Silky and dry, the wine has flattering flavors of cherry compote, cola and Provençal herbs.",,88,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"With no oak influences at all, this Chard is on the acidic side, with bright, clean flavors of green grapes, yellow apricots and fresh pineapples. It's dry, but rich in fruity essence.",Unoaked,85,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Domaine Chandon
US,"The grapes represent an interesting span, coming from Carneros, Dry Creek Valley and even some from Mendocino's Eaglepoint Ranch. The blend is Zin, with Syrah and Petite Syrah. The flavors are a wild medley of LifeSaver candies, and the finish is too sweet.",L'Etranger Zinfandel Blend,84,39,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Vie Winery
US,"A good, dry Merlot that shows plenty of fruity structure. Satisfies with flavors of cherries and blackberries, with earthier notes of cola, licorice and tobacco, and there's a briary, brambly feeling all the way through. Best now.",,87,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"Kent Rosenblum readily concedes some of his reds have residual sugar, and I'm certain this one does. Yet lots of people like these wines, with their chocolaty, blackberry and blueberry pie filling, toffee and caramelly oak flavors. This one will please Rosenblum's many fans.",Hillside Vineyards,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Rosenblum
US,"Superripe, a Zin with a soft, thick texture and almost desserty flavors of chocolate soufflé infused with crème de cassis and cherry jam. It's probably technically dry, but leaves behind a sweet aftertaste.",PoiZin,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Armida
US,"This is the kind of Merlot that appeals to so many diners who are looking for a dry, fairly sophisticated red wine whose cost won't break the bank. Soft and silky, it has herb-infused cherry and smoky oak flavors.",,85,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"Finishes a little sweet, soft and simple, but the cherry and cola flavors have a richness that satisfies. Drink now.",,84,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Tastes more like a Zin than a Cab, with rustic tannins and a peppery, briary flavor of wild berries. The wine is dry, but way too soft for any development, so drink now.",Rockpile Vineyard,84,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paradise Ridge
US,"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend drinks harsh and somewhat medicinal. It has peppery flavors of cherries, blackberries, mint and herbs, and the tannins are a little on the green side.",Victory Reserve,84,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Wellington

US,"I like the varietal richness of this Gewürz. It shows powerful, classic tropical fruit and wildflower flavors, with potent cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and vanilla spices that dominate the finish. A bit soft, but a very nice wine for the price.",,85,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Kenwood
US,"Solidly in the winery's house style, this is a clean, varietally true Chard, dry and balanced. It shows citrus, green apple and mineral flavors, while partial barrel fermentation adds elements of smoky cream and buttered toast.",,84,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong

US,"Higher in alcohol than Kenwood's regular '05 Sonoma Zin, this one's hotter and more full-bodied. It's got a density that can stand a little bottle age.

US,"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine. Blending from a vast source of vineyards has given winemaker Cabral the ability to fill in divots of every kind.

US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",Reserve,91,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
US,"From a new winery that uses estate grapes that fall outside of any appellation besides the countywide one, this big, dry Syrah is very appealing. It's Northern Rhône in style, with cherry and blackberry flavors laced with leather and herb  otes, and the tannins are sizable. This is a wine to watch. Drink now through 2007.",,92,48,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Bugay

US,"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.",Reserve,96,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean

US,"Lots to like about this wine, from the Sonoma side of Spring Mountain. Shows firm, fine tannins and well-developed blackberry and cherry flavors.

US,"This top-of-the-line Cab surely must be one of the last 2001s to be released. It's an exquisite wine. New oak dominates, with caramelized vanilla and char. But it's appropriate given the size of the fruit. The black currant, Hoison sauce, crème de cassis, milk chocolate and licorice flavors are completely satisfying. Best now and for the next ten years.",Reserve,93,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"There can't be too many 2001 Merlots waiting to be released, and St. Jean must have waited to let the tannins soften. They have.

US,"This may be the most expensive Malbec in California, but it's a really good wine that is full-bodied and deeply flavored. Like a great Cabernet, it shows polished black currant, spicy plum and new-oak flavors, with wonderfully rich, sweet tannins and soft acids.

US,"Try sneaking this into your next wine group blind tasting. It might turn some heads.

With a drop of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, it has true complexity.",,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Ray's Station Vineyards
US,"This is an awfully good wine.

There's a complex velvety softness that caresses the finish.",,91,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Sebastiani
US,"Good, deep flavors in this dry Cabernet. They include well-developed blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and tobacco, with savory hints of licorice, black pepper and cinnamon toast, smeared with plum jam. The texture could be a little smoother, as it's somewhat gritty.",Glen Oaks Ranch,87,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clarbec
US,Pushes Zinfandel to the limit of balance. The alcohol is nearly 16%. The tannins are hard. The blackberry and currant flavors wander into raisins.

US,"This is a new winery for me, and it's a promising start. The wine is decadently rich in cassis, cherries, milk chocolate and vanilla flavors, but it has the structural integrity of a fine wine.

US,"I really like this wine, which in so many ways is classic Sonoma Zin. It's dry and full-bodied, with sturdy tannins and ripe, forward Zin flavors that finish in a swirl of spicy fruit.

US,"This is from a vineyard high in the Mayacamas on the Sonoma side of Diamond Mountain. The wine was made by Marco DiGiulio, a well-known consulting winemaker in Napa Valley. It's a big, thick 100% mountain Cabernet, intense in cassis, dark chocolate and new oak, and an interesting hit of Provençal herbs. It's also high in alcohol and low in acidity, which may inhibit ageability.",,88,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge

It has Sauvignon's dry, acidic citrusy character, while the Muscat adds a rich orange blossom note. Simply wonderful and refreshingly different.",Wow Oui White Burgundy,90,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,White Blend,Imagery
US,"Largely clean, but big-boned and a bit hot. This wines pumps a ton of flavor, which if you like loud, heavy citrus and stone fruits is a good sign. But it's also a touch sticky and grabby.

US,"Shows the impeccable balance you expect from this master winemaker, even in this hot vintage, where supermaturity was a challenge. The wine is certainly ripe, offering a mouthful of blackberries, cherries and currants. But it never loses its elegant tannin-acid architecture. Beautiful now, and should develop through 2014.",,93,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"Dark and dramatically rich, with blackberry jam, cherry-pie filling, milk chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors, this polished wine has gorgeously fine tannins. It could use greater acidity for structure, though, because it's very soft and melted, which makes all that fruit taste sugary sweet.",Old Vine,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Now in its third vintage, this complex Bordeaux blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, performs at the height of Sebastiani's red portfolio. Mainly from great vineyards in Alexander and Sonoma valleys, it's very much in the modern style, soft and ripe. Yet it maintains an elegant dignity, and it passes the threepeat test: You want a second glass, and then a third.",Secolo Red Wine,92,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sebastiani
US,"I love this wine for the way the winemaker has reined in Viognier's tendency toward over-the-topness, yet not sacrificed its exotic character.

US,"Pop a steak on the grill and enjoy this robust wine. A blend of Dry Creek, Russian River, Alexander Valley and Knights Valley fruit, with a little Paso Robles thrown in for good measure, it's classic Zin, dry, fruity and peppery.

US,"Aloof and tannic now. It's very dry, and those tannins lock in and cry out for something to melt them. It's best to decant this wine many hours in advance of drinking it, but it should develop well over the next eight to ten years.",Cinq Cepages,90,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean

US,"Smooth, polished and ripe, this is a blend of Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley. Those are both warm appellations, and in this warm vintage, the wine is extremely ripe.

US,"There's lot of oak on top of a somewhat thin wine, but it's pleasant enough, with modest pineapple and peach flavors and dusty spices. Finishes quick, with oak flavors.",Sonoma County,85,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Showing some rough, inelegant edges, this Cab doesn't seem fully ripened. The blackberry and cherry flavors finish with a green note, and the wine is fully dry.",,83,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Complex, with plum, clove, oaky vanilla and grilled meat notes. Drinks very dry, with firm tannins. Shows real style in the overall balance and harmony.",,86,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Ceja
US,"Lots to like in this wine. It has ripe peach and pear flavors, with a blast of smoky oak, buttered toast and lees. Finishes rich in honeyed fruit.",,86,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Château Souverain
US,"Ripe in tropical fruit and peaches, and fairly oaky. The rich, creamy texture and long, spicy finish are pleasant.",,86,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lambert Bridge
US,"Sweet in caramelized oak and vanilla, with very rich, ripe tropical fruit and pear flavors, this is a decadent Chard. Fortunately, it has good acidity and is clean and firm on the finish.",,86,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Craig
US,"High in acidity, almost sour despite complete malo, this is a very dry wine, and it's thin in fruity flavor. Will do in a pinch, but you can do better for the money.",,82,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"The '03 is elegant and sleek, with blackberry and cassis flavors that finish thoroughly dry. But even at 4-plus years, the tannins are very harsh. Could surprise in a decade, but it's a gamble.",Artist Series,87,70,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Hits the top of the yummy scale. Massive flavors of tropical fruits, peaches, vanilla custard, honeysuckle, butterscotch, all of it smooth and creamy. Impacts the palate enormously; a big wine all the way through.",,92,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Pride Mountain
US,"The wine is 100% Cabernet, sourced from a vineyard in the Mayacamas. It's very tannic and dry at this point. Such is the massive fruit core, of cassis and cherries, and the overall balance, that the wine must age well, even though it has no history of doing so. Hold until 2010 and try again.",Brigden Vineyard,93,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Owl Ridge
US,"Has all the hallmarks of the winery's style, which are good varietal character at a fair price. This time around, however, the wine's plum and berry flavors are thin, and are accompanied by some harsh tannins.",,84,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Valley of the Moon
US,"Master vintner Dick Arrowood has crafted a sensational wine from a sensational vintage. A blend from throughout the county, it shows his discernment in the overall balance, harmony and charm. Black currants, chocolate, green olives, sweet sage and vanilla-scented oak flavors come together in a lush, smooth, intricately structured wine that will probably hold for 10 years, but is best in its flamboyant, exuberant youth.",,93,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"Fruity, oaky, creamy and slightly sweet, this Chard is solidly in the international style. It offers flavors of peaches, pears, vanilla and buttered toast.",,85,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
US,"Simple, with the taste and feel of alcohol-laced lemonade. The citrusy, spearminty flavors are a little sweet, and the wine finishes with a thud.",,83,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Adobe Creek
US,"Merlot has not been the winery's strong suit over the years, but with this vintage, something has changed. The wine is lush and complex. There are enormously deep cherry, mocha and oak flavors, with the rich tannic structure Ferrari-Carano's reds always have the classic finish.",,91,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Ferrari-Carano
US,"Dark cherry and cream cheese-like aromas open onto a palate chock full of tart cherry, tangy oak and mint flavors. It's got moderate acidity, and a tangy, dry finish.",,82,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Shiraz,Geyser Peak
US,"This Bordeaux blend is showing its youth with a rawly acidic scour that frames jammy, fairly sweet cherry and cassis flavors, and feels disjointed. But it may just need some time in the bottle. Try after 2008. No guarantees.",Milestone Red Wine,86,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pellegrini
US,"Chunky and full up front, but with grassy, green aromas. Quite tart the moment you taste it; there's cranberry and wild huckleberry flavors, and a short, borderline sour finish. Too much tartness, with almost orange-like acidity.",Reserve,81,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"A middle of the road Merlot, dry and fairly tannic, with berry and earth flavors.",,83,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Simi
US,"Right now, it shows its tannins and acids strongly, and is relieved only by hints of cherries, plums and currants. Yet the finish turns ripely sweet. Best after 2010.",,88,34,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gary Farrell
US,"Beautiful and soft as an Impressionist painting. Flavors of cherries, black raspberries, spices and herbs are wrapped in rich, easy tannins, coating the palate and finishing ripe but dry. Delicious on its own and immediately drinkable. A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Siena,92,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano
US,"From a legendary winemaker, a wine designed for the cellar. Dick Arrowood shunned the easy approach, instead crafting a fairly tannic wine with a solid core of blackberry, cherry and herb flavors. Although the tannins are soft in the modern way, it's best after 2005.",Reserve Speciale,92,85,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"Odd that this wine costs less than Wellington's Sonoma Valley bottling, because while it shares the same qualities of cassis, smoke and a smooth texture, it's a shade richer and more concentrated. Feels absolutely beautiful as it slides across the palate, all the way through the pleasing aftertaste.",Mohrhardt Vineyard,92,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"Kenwood's regular Sauvignon Blanc was a hard act to top. This one costs two bucks more, and while it's richer in creamy oak and lees, it's really not better, just different. It's a yummy, complex wine, and this is a great price for this quality.",Reserve,90,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"Run, don't walk, to buy this by the case. It's California SB at its best, long and deep in gooseberry and alfalfa flavors, but complexed with richer notes of lime, peach custard and vanilla pudding. But it's not a sweetie. It's dry and crisp in acids.",,90,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"Lots to like in this ultra- dry wine, with its soothingly rich tannins and flavors of wild berries, peppery spices and herbs, and earthy tobacco. Could have a bit more concentration, but it's quintessential Sonoma Zin.",Hoenselaars Vineyard Upper Block,87,27,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Paradise Ridge
US,"Lots of true Pinot character in this dry, elegant wine, which contains mainly Russian River fruit. Made for early drinking, it has complex cherry, root beer, pomegranate, herb tea and spice flavors, wrapped into a delicately silky texture.",,89,34,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This old Sonoma grapegrowing family's hommage to their forebears is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. It is an excellent wine, succulently filled with juicy flavors of cherries and blackcurrants, with sexy tannins that are muscular, but negotiable. It will probably soften in a few years.",Omaggio,91,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Seghesio
US,"Richer and more complete than the '98 La Joie, with which it was simultaneously released. This wine shows its mountain origins in its tough young tannins and hard edges, but there is enough cherry and blackberry fruit for the long haul. Oak adds vanilla and toast, but this is a wine you need to cellar until 2009.",La Joie,90,100,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Verité
US,"A blend of the big three Cabernet valleys, Alexander, Sonoma and Dry Creek. Polished and elegant, with good berry flavors balanced with green olive, dill, unsweetened chocolate and earth. Feels plush in the mouth, smooth and soft, but complex. Good enough for your best fare.",,90,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
US,"I have seldom tasted a Dry Creek Valley Cabernet (the appellation, not the winery) that didn't have a woolly edge to it. This wine is an excellent example. It's briary, with pushy tannins and the succulent flavor of wild blackberries. Oak adds a sheen of vanilla and smoke.",,90,21,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Starts out very clean, with focused, sharp aromas of lemon, lime, and grapefruit, with some floral, honeyed notes. Citrus is also the name of the game in the flavors, particularly racy pink grapefruit. There seems to be just enough residual sugar to soften and fatten it up right through the swift, fruity finish.",,85,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"A grassy, herbaceous wine, almost aggressively so. Definitely veers toward those grapefruit, cat-pee aromas that characterize less-than-ripe grapes. In the mouth, it's very tart and lean and crisp, with high acidity. A bracing dose of oak gives it some sweetness and fatness. Those who like this style will find it clean and refreshing.",,84,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Great depth and purity of fruit. It shines with lovely violet and lavender accents. Very dark cassis, black plum, coffee and toasty oak flavors, with handsome herb and spice accents. The mouthfeel is excellent—big, but almost perfectly balanced between lush richness and solid tannic structure. A keeper needing four to six years.",T Bar T,94,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Iron Horse
US,"There's an elegant balance to this wine, a mellowness that's partly due to its age, and partly to the winemaking talents of Dick Arrowood. Belies its price with real richness of fruit, oak, cream, acids and lees that impress.",Grand Archer,88,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Arrowood
US,"Peaches and cream, buttered toast, a squeeze of vanilla and a dusting of cinnamon pretty much describes this tasty Chard. It has extra layers of complexity in the balance and long finish.",,88,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood
US,"Full and plush, with complex aromas of cassis, cinnamon, earth, cedar, coffee and cream. Low in acidity, it is large in depth of fruit and flavor, with black currants, earth and coffee reigning on the palate and into the finish. A sensuous texture and long finish with soft tannins complete the pleasure package. Very approachable; drink now through 2008.",T-bar-T Benchmark,94,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Iron Horse
US,"Fine clarity of fruit, with coffee, cherry and nicely utilized oak. Intense flavors of blackberry, plum and cedar mark the palate, which displays a full texture. The long, smooth and tangy finish wraps it up nicely. Drinks well now; will be even better after two or three years.",Staten Family Reserve,93,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Field Stone
US,"Blackberries and some spicy wood in the form of cedar make for an inviting nose. More blackberry flavors, with additions of cocoa on the layered, enticing palate. It strikes the right balance of weight and tang. It's a refreshing wine with the legs to run the race.",Encounter Pine Mountain,92,42,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Gary Farrell
US,"Not showing much now. It's muted in both aroma and flavor, with the oak and tannins dominating. There are plum, chocolate and blackberry flavors, but this wine's long-term future is doubtful.",Ladi's Vineyard,86,75,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Meritage,Deerfield Ranch
US,"Beautiful Sonoma Zin, sourced mainly from Alexander Valley. Although the winemaker had to struggle against shriveled, raisiny fruit, the wine shows a soft complexity. Ripe and forward in cherry-berry, tobacco, rum baba, coffee and crushed hard spices, it finishes long and dry.",Reserve,88,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
US,"Ultraripe berry, herb, cedar, and toast aromas. Refined plum, licorice, and coffee flavors show great appeal, and the supple, elegant mouthfeel plays into the finish with dark fruit and cocoa-powder notes. Bright tannins and good fruit-to-acid balance promise a fine future. Hold for two to four years; drink to 2014.",Reserve,92,65,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Lancaster
US,"This year Byington blended in some Syrah with the Cabernet Sauvignon, to good effect. I wish the wine were crisper and better structured, but there's no denying the deliciousness factor. The black currant pudding, cherry pie and vanilla-sprinkled mocha flavors are irresistible.",Alliage,87,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Byington
US,"This Merlot straddles that interesting line between easy, everyday drinking and real complexity. It's dry and richly tannic, and is the sort of wine that won't win a blind tasting, but leaves you reaching for a third glass with that steak.",Grand Archer,87,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood
US,"A brooding, intense nose of deep black fruits, violets and sweet leather opens to a full palate with fine fruit-to-acid balance. Black currant and earth flavors prevail, and the wine is more burly than plush. It closes with tart cherry and anise flavors. Good now, and better in two years; can drink to 2008.",Reserve,90,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Benziger
US,"A good price for a very nice Merlot, from a winery with an increasingly respectable track record. The wine is dry and balanced, with a smooth texture and blackberry, coffee and chocolate flavors.",,86,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Domaine St. George
US,"Leathery fruit and a bit of bramble or field greens mark the nose, and the earthy red-currant palate strikes a claret-like note. It's a little lighter than the competition, and it does show some defined tartness. Drink sooner than later, and try to serve it with food.",,90,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wattle Creek
US,"Big mountain fruit here throws powerful aromas of ripe plum, thyme and bacon, while full-scale oaking yields maple aromas, vanilla flavors, and coffee on the finish. The wood element is a little weighty at this point, but there's solid fruit to support it.",Buckeye Vyd,90,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
US,"A power-packed heavyweight from Sonoma, this delivers a piercing black-fruit aroma and flavor profile. Cassis and plum flavors are tight and tasty, and the long, juicy finish indicates that it could evolve nicely. Anyone planning on drinking it soon should expect a punch. Elegance is not its strong suit right now.",Christopher's Vineyard,90,70,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"“Swan Song” indicates that this is the last vintage of Cabernet to be produced from this vineyard block. So enjoy it while it's here: There's plenty of dry black cherry, licorice, cola and smoked meat, and dusty tannins with nice grip close the show. Our critique is that this is an excellent finalé.",Sarah Block Swan Song Reserve,90,39,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Murphy-Goode
US,"There may be a little oak on this Chard, but the fruit really stars. The apple, peach and apricot flavors are perked up by crisp acidity, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 13%. This is a good price for a wine of this quality.",Barrel Reserve,86,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. George
US,"Very black-fruited and equally heavy on the toasted oak, which together yield a menthol-and-mint aroma package. A bit of a love-it-or-leave-it wine, as its extreme oaking leaves the impression of espresso and char. The finish is on the short side, and the body a bit hollow given its gigantic proportions.",Estate Bottled,88,90,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy
US,"This wine is clean, good and tasty. It's not especially complex, but shows berry, cherry, spice and oak flavors that are wrapped in a soft, balanced package.",,86,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Paradise Ridge
US,"Deep briary, wild-berry and pepper aromas. In the mouth, it's ripe and sweetly fruity, with soft tannins and pepper-spice notes. It's bone dry, with adequate acidity. Classic Sonoma Zin in its expressive exuberance and unpolished likeability.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,88,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"Lots of winemaker influence here in the leesy quality and oaky notes that have been added to an underlying wine tasting of apples and pears. The result is a dry, complex Chard that finishes with a bite of green apple acidity.",Nagasawa Vineyard,87,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paradise Ridge
US,"Sneak this one into a blind tasting of Cabs costing twice as much and it will hold its own. It's smooth  and opulent, with oak-kissed blackberry, licorice, tobacco and mocha flavors and rich tannins, and the finish is dry and balanced.",Barrel Reserve,86,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. George
US,"Tobacco and some green pepper on an otherwise fruity plain. When you think of cru bourgeois Bordeaux, this fits the image and flavor profile. It's lean, but balanced. Tea and licorice are definable on the finish.",,88,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arbios
US,"You'll find some tasty apricots, peach and vanilla-oak flavors in this soft, creamy wine. It's a nice California Chardonnay, slightly sweet in the finish, and a great accompaniment to salmon or pork.",,85,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Here's a soft, gentle wine that's gooey-rich in cherry, cocoa-puff and ripe, sweet black raspberry flavors. Lightly oaked, it has a cleansing, espresso bitterness on the finish.",,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Sebastiani
US,"What you get in this pretty wine is the character of a much more expensive Cab, just a little thinned down. Blackcurrant and cherry flavors, a nice veneer of oak, rich, intricate tannins and good acidity combine to make this balanced.",,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"Nice and rich in toasty oak, framing mouthfilling flavors of pineapples, papaya, peach and cinnamon spice. Feels creamy-smooth, with a good tang of acidity.",,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"Cab Franc alone rarely makes a great wine in California, and this one's no exception. It's awfully nice in initial raspberry-cherry flavors, but loses substantial power and vitality midpalate, especially given the size of the tannins.",,86,56,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
US,"Light and crisp, this tart little Pinot boasts just enough cola and black cherry flavors to make it a worthwhile match with roast chicken, or perhaps grilled salmon.",,85,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois
US,"Has a compelling and complex nose offering pepper, cinnamon, and black cherry, with earthy accents. A medium-weight wine, it shows good balance and sweet-and-sour flavors. The buttered black-toast/popcorn element rides a bit heavy on the cherry fruit. Herzog is on the right track; a few years ago a wine of this quality bearing the Kosher label was inconceivable.",Special Reserve,86,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
US,"Aromas of red berries, cherries, cedar and herbs open this reserved offering. Lean and a bit astringent on the palate now, it offers some berry, pepper and chocolate notes on the palate. It never really opens up, and even thins a bit at the end. Regrettably, it fails to impress in this company.",,86,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jordan
US,"This wine typically requires years to open up; now it's very tight and only offers a modicum of leather, toast and black-currant aromas. The plum and blackberry fruit is chunky, not stylish. The acids are bold, and the tannins are bulky, which masks what charm might be hidden beneath.",,86,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
US,"Has a decent texture on the palate, but some difficult earthy, even horsey aromas are hard to get past. The sweet currant, chocolate, and espresso flavors that follow are pleasant, and the wine finishes dry, with chalky tannins and a bitter cocoa note.",,86,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santo Stefano
US,"Opens with aromas of wild berries, white pepper, earth and a trace of leather. Tough and unyielding tannins coat the palate, and you'll need some meat to break through this gridlock, but underneath it all is a core of ripe dark-berry fruit. This could use 3–6 years of aging.",Morning Sun,86,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"This is a challenging Zin. It's fruity but it's also earthy and mushroomy, with a blast of vanilla oak. Right now it's pretty tannic, but beneath that roughness is a core of fruit. It's austere now—difficult even—but some time in the cellar could soften and open it.",Rocky Terrace,86,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"This Sonoma County Chardonnay is a mainstream success, with ripe, peachy fruit, leesy notes and not that much oak. It finishes dry, clean and crisp, with a slight bitter-almond note.",,86,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
US,"Lemons, limes, spearmint and green melon flavors, tart and fresh with acidity. A clean, vibrant and assertive wine, dry and bitter. Nice by itself or with seared halibut topped with fruity salsa.",Grandview Vineyard,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Paradise Ridge
US,"Elegant rather than powerful, this Bordeaux blend shows earth, cherry, blackberry and herb flavors wrapped in gentle oak. It's a bit tannic, just enough to bite into a nice piece of beef.",,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Meritage,Lyeth
US,"Smooth and polished, and just happens to be delicious. You'll find clean, soft flavors of lime, orange zest, honeydew melon and spice, with oaky shadings.",Reserve,86,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kenwood
US,"It's not a vintage wine, and there's a slightly green, peppery note, but that just adds a piquant touch to the cherry-cocoa fruit in this easy-to-savor Merlot. It's dry and balanced, and, and at the equivalent of a buck-fifty a bottle, it's a super buy.",3L,84,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Black Box
US,"Rustic, country-style, but ripe in Cabernet fruit, with a rich tannin structure and a long, dry finish. Shows real polish in the upfront blackberry, cherry and currant flavors.",Angeline,84,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
US,"Crystal-clear California Chardonnay, with its trademark pineapple, pear and citrus flavors offset by a hit of creamy oak and buttery notes. Toast and butterscotch marry with faint lemon flavors on the finish.",Sonoma Cask,87,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
US,"A nice, easy Zin with some special features. It's dry and balanced in alcohol, acids and tannins, with ripe flavors and a smooth mouth feel. The touch of rusticity should play well against ribs and barbecued chicken.",Eight Cousins Vineyard,85,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Pellegrini
US,"A little raw, with sharp elbows of tannins and acids. Don't be too fussy, just enjoy the plummy, grapy flavors.",,84,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Bois
US,"Emphasizes oak-derived elements—toast, cream and hints of menthol—backed up by pineapple and other tropical fruits. A big, hefty mouthful.",Damaris Reserve,86,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Landmark
US,"The flagship of the Peter Michael Chardonnays is a stylish, sexy wine. Opens with a wonderful nose of peach, tropical fruit, nuts and orange tea; it shows great poise and a classic sense of proportion from bouquet to finish. The wine unfolds and expands in the glass, offering lovely orange, mineral and tarragon flavors. The engaging finish has great length and subtle aromas and flavors. Impressive for its restraint and attention to detail, this is delicious now but will also reward keeping. Cellar Selection.",Cuvee Indigene,92,85,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
US,"This wine's fat, tropical fruit, banana and toast nose has a pungent, spicy Gewürztraminer quality. The palate is the payoff. It shows the aforementioned elements, plus cinnamon, clove and vanilla flavors. What you get is a ripe, unctuous wine—big, maybe even a bit overblown, but totally lovable. The long, spicy finish of this unique bottling is impressive.",Reserve,91,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ledson
US,"Displaying great fruit and excellent structure, this can be enjoyed now, but it has soon scale and intensity that we suggest aging it for at least another year or two. Barelli seems to yield darkly-fruited wines of depth and structure that read somewhat tighter and harder in their youth. Has classic cassis, toasty oak and tobacco touches, plus a dusty Alexander Valley feel.",Barelli Creek,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Lots of spice along with a veritable fruit cocktail of complex flavors open this understated performer. From green apple and bosc pears to melon and mint, it has an elegant integration of fruit and spicy, vanillin oak. Tangy acidity keeps it lively, and the wine finishes crisp and dry. Still tight, this could use a year to knit itself together.",Stone Côte Vineyard,91,33,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"It's said that Dick Arrowood personally checks every bottle that goes out—his attention to detail shows here. A complex and refined bouquet of toasted oat, coconut, orange and peach opens to a full palate of apple, yellow plum and caramel flavors. Rich and creamily textured, it is also high on spice and smoky oak. The complex finish is very long, leesy and elegantly nuanced.",Reserve Speciale Cuvée Michel Berthoud,91,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Arrowood
US,"Shows real Zinny character with its brambly berry fruit, which tastes of the sun in every ripe taste. Lots of spicy notes, with an edge of espresso. This dry wine is soft in acids and tannins.",Reserve,85,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"You get a combo of ripe blackberry and cherry alongside sharp green tea notes in this wine. It's dry, with smooth tannins and an astringent finish.",Ladi's Vineyard,85,29,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paradise Ridge
US,"They kept the alcohol moderate, but at the obvious cost of residual sugar. This overtly sweet wine tastes like the old kosher stuff I grew up with.",Barrel Reserve,80,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,St. George
US,"The nose is welcoming, with aromas of buttered toast and spice. But the flavors are overwhelmingly lemony and tart—a strange amalgam that doesn't quite come together.",,84,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dreyer Sonoma
US,"Crème brûlée creaminess combines with tart citrus fruitiness in this wine, which displays great balance and richness. A nice oak frame holds it all together and provides a handsome framework for the lime-orange-tangerine citrus core. The palate has buttery caramel and wintergreen accents. Long, serene finish.",Reserve,91,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
US,"A tart pineapple-lemon nose with caramel and smoke accents ushers in a full palate. Apple and pear flavors add body, and a chalky note contributes complexity and texture to the palate. Slight creaminess provides a fat, full feel, but maybe just a bit more softness than some tasters preferred. Still, this is a solid wine with finesse and body. It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.",Mon Plaisir,90,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
US,"In this fine offering from one of this tasting's most consistent performers, a nutty, pineapple-ginger nose opens to a lively mouth of citrus, hazelnut and spice. The feel is firm, elegant. This handsomely constructed wine finishes long with subtle white peach notes, with dashes of tangy spice and chalk.",Belle Côte,90,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
US,"This Chardonnay, from a small vineyard block in Jess Jackson's Alexander Mountain estate, is grand yet graceful. Oozing pear, butterscotch, melon and menthol flavors, it shows good weight and a positive richness that's supported by firm structure. It's balanced, appealing, admirably not overoaked and finishes long with flavors of melon, spice and pear offset by toasty accents. Top Value.",Block Sixty-Six,90,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"Fine flavor definition and very good acidity. Citrus, apple and herb aromas sing on the nose. Round apple, anise and pineapple show on the velvety palate. The wine finishes with a pretty melding of pineapple and vanilla, like an elegant tropical creamsicle. Enticing, but still tight enough to warrant holding it for a year or two.",La Carriere,90,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
US,"Helen Turley's Chardonnay shows nice complexity, particularly on the nose, where nuanced oriental spice, tobacco, nectarine, floral and yellow fruit aromas play with the senses. The palate is mild and balanced, with melon, stone fruit and nut flavors, and a smooth texture to boot. Just a touch of heat shows on the long, dry yet spicy finish.",Gauer Vineyard,89,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Canepa
US,"Shows nice berry and earth flavors, with Zin's brambly edge, and finishes dry and balanced. The texture is soft.",Branham Rockpile,84,32,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Galleron
US,"Announces itself with an unusual and pleasant Gewürtztraminer-like tangerine, lychee and ginger nose. Its mild but decidedly unique character is clearer on the melon, butter-cinnamon and peach palate. Nice acidity and a tangy-spicy finish.",Kent Ritchie Vineyard,89,35,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Scott Paul
US,"Nice sweet-tart flavors and a medium mouthfeel make this is one of our most-enjoyed California renditions of Tuscany's workhorse red. The tart black cherry, leather and slight mineral notes are on target, the finish smooth and delicious.",,89,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Lovely aromas, flavors and a fine mouthfeel define this rare item—a real Pinot Noir value. Appealing black cherry, earth, and tarragon aromas and flavors keep the taster interested, suggesting a broad range of food pairings, from salmon to lamb. It even offers decent body and length, almost unheard of in this price range.",,88,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.",Whitney's Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fisher
US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind. This full-bodied, nicely textured Chardonnay has nutty, smoky and spicy flavors melding with tangy tropical fruit to create a tasty, fairly lush wine that's easy to enjoy. Finishes soft, with a faint whiff of petrol—in the Alsace manner—and is drinking well now.",David Selby Reserve,88,38,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Selby
US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas. More candy apple-like flavors appear in the mouth, accompanied by tropical fruit and toasty accents with a rich caramel tone. It verges on too-sweet, but it's nonetheless pleasing in an uncomplicated way.",,87,33,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.",Sangiacomo Vineyards Reserve,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bernardus
US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors. Mouthfeel is dry and briskly acid—but with a nice chalky note, too. Chalk shows again on the finish, where it somewhat checks the sharp lemony-metallic notes.",Seascape Vineyard,87,46,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford
US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness. It's slightly hot, with dominant butterscotch and vanillin oaky flavors.",Upper Barn,87,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.",Barelli Creek Vineyard,86,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Barbera,E & J Gallo
US,"Dry, tart and fairly one-dimensional, this Cab has mixed flavors of blackberries, cherries and Kahlúa, with a peppery, minty streak. The tannins are a bit edgy. Might improve with a year or two of cellaring.",,85,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
US,"Dried-herb shadings add an extra touch of complexity to this dense wine that combines rich plum, mocha and earth elements. A big, bold Merlot that avoids being overblown by virtue of its strong undercurrent of acidity.",Reserve,91,41,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Benziger
US,"Solid black currant and cedar aromas and flavors predominate in this dry, well-structured red. Toasty oak complements dark, dusty Alexander Valley fruit. The wine finishes elegantly, with spicy notes and ripe, even tannins. Ready to drink now.",,90,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wattle Creek
US,"Both Old and New World elements are evident in this Shiraz. The round, easy mouthfeel and nose of berry, chocolate and cumin say “New World.” The palate has more Old World notes of leather, game and dry licorice surrounding the fruit core. Dark oak, licorice and tart berry flavors play out on the complex finish.",,89,39,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Shiraz,Wattle Creek
US,"The aromas mingle black cherry and dark chocolate with mint, plus modest oak. In the mouth, it really comes alive with deeply satisfying flavors and soft velvety tannins.",Reserve,89,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Clos du Bois
US,"After a string of great vintages, this bottling is a disappointment. After four-plus years, it remains quite tannic, with an acidic astringency.",Artist Series,84,70,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Light floral, orange blossom and peach aromas open this large-scaled white. The weighty palate shows mild orange and spice flavors. Has plenty of zip for its relative heft, and finishes long, with tangy pepper notes.",,88,24,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Wattle Creek
US,"Smooth apple-pear and buttery, toasty aromas open to like flavors. That fruit core is offset by mild mango accents and lots of spicy oak, which continue through the long finish. For fans of rich, oaky full-bodied Chardonnay.",,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Wattle Creek
US,"Very polite and proper: not too much oak, not too much fruit. All the ingredients are here in proportion, from the cedary, caramelized oak to the black-cherry and plum fruit that carries hints of dark earth and coffee.",Ladi's Vineyard,87,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Gary Farrell
US,"A fig, herb and grapefruit bouquet sets the stage. The fig element becomes a more nut-like flavor on the palate and the wine has a round, slightly viscous texture, in the full style of the other Wattle Creek whites. Finishes dry, with just a hint of tartness.",,87,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wattle Creek
US,"Pretty aromas of cherries, chocolate, and vanilla open into berry flavors that are balanced, rich and very dry, with some dusty tannins. Has a round elegance that's tableworthy.",Signature Series,86,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Windsor
US,"The aromas are herbal, flirting dangerously with green pepper before eventually settling somewhere between oregano and tea. The juicy black cherries on the palate compensate somewhat, and the oak is understated. Best with herb-laced beef or lamb to help accentuate the fruit.",Vineyards of TreMonte,86,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Ferrari-Carano
US,"The initial aromas of barrel-aging cellar—sweet, dusty wood mixed with plummy, grapey fruit—give way to flavors of black cherries and toast that extend through the supple finish.",Barrel Select,85,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Fetzer
US,"Aromas of toast and cedar blend in a little mint over black cherries. This wine has pretty flavors of cherries, cedar, bitter chocolate and tea, but possesses a certain austerity and restraint. Finishes with some dry tannins; you could age this wine, but you'd be taking a chance—much better to enjoy it now.",Proprietor Grown,84,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Hanna
US,"A step outside the company's comfort zone, and it shows. While this is better than much of what Delicato sells, it's not that much better to warrant the extra price. A hint of shoe polish mars the cassis-scented nose, while the palate delivers standard chocolate and black currant flavors and a lean, sculpted mouthfeel. This limited-production bottling is available only at the tasting room.",Vine Select Monte Rosso Vineyard,87,70,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Delicato
US,Savory dried herbs accent the otherwise soft and simple black cherries that dominate this wine. Closes with some sweet cola and chocolate notes. A solid by-the-glass offering.,,84,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Clos du Bois
US,"You get mostly cedar and charred oak at first, with hints of cherries and mocha. This is one affordable Merlot that doesn't lack for structure—it's just that the structure seems largely wood-derived, leaving insufficient fruit flesh to fill in the gaps.",,82,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Geyser Peak
US,"This inaugural vintage from an ambitious winery is ripe and powerful and oaky, as expensive Cabs tend to be. On the deficit side is overripe fruit, with a raisiny finish and a heavy texture, but the wine is fully dry and does possess some elegance. Drink over the next five years.",Sonoma County Mountains,87,60,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Roy J. Maier
US,"Classic Northern California Cabernet at a fair price, which makes it a value these days. It begins with aromas of black currants, anise and smoky, charry oak, and doesn't disappoint on the palate. There's plenty of polished blackberry and currant fruit, with a nice blast of oak. Very dry and clean. You notice how well it scours the mouth and stays crisp and elegant on the finish.",,88,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"An exquisite wine that combines delicacy and harmony with enormously fruity-spicy flavors that fill the mouth. The aromas suggest candied ginger, tropical fruits, vanilla and wildflowers. The flavors are effusively fruity and on the dry side, with refreshingly crisp acidity. Try it with Asian-Pacific fusion foods.",,87,12,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Mark West
US,"A likable, easy-drinking Chard that won't bust your budget, with plenty of ripe flavors and winemaker bells and whistles. It's got spicy, vanilla-accented peach aromas, and while it drinks a bit thin, it's got some class and style. The finish lasts for a pretty long time, with oaky, spicy flavors. This is a good value, especially from a top winery. Best Buy.",,87,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"This wine captures Pinot's silky, spicy qualities, although it's thin, light and basic. Some pretty notes of raspberry, smoke, sun-dried tomato, mushroom and chocolate and a nice, spicy intensity on the palate. The tannins are soft and light, and it snaps to a quick finish.",,86,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois
US,"Lees and oak dominate the nose of this very ripe wine. The result is size: A big, rich, oaky, fruity quaff, it fills the mouth with flavors and palate impressions. At the same time, it's a one-dimensional wine; it assaults the senses, but on one plane. Finishes semi-sweet.",,85,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Light, tasty and simple, it offers up pretty aromas of red raspberries, smoke and vanilla. In the mouth it's fruity and soft. There's good extracted fruit and a generous dusting of oak. It can't quite achieve complexity, but it's a nice wine that's thoroughly enjoyable.",,85,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mark West
US,"If you're looking for a kosher Chard, try this one. It's a fine wine, rich in fruit, well-oaked and balanced, with the creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel you want in this varietal. The peach custard, pineapple and kiwi flavors are simply delicious.",Cellar Select,88,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Weinstock Cellars
US,"From a value leader, another rich, creamy, toasty Chard, loaded with peach, apple and pear flavors and a lot of oak. Good acidity and a long finish, but it has a little too much sugar to be considered dry.",,85,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Château Souverain
US,"Very sweet, with powerful apricot, tangerine, pineapple and creme brulee flavors and good acidity to balance out the sugar. Vanilla ice cream would be a good match.",Soleil Late Harvest,87,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"Full-bodied, soft and approachable, with rich aromas of vanilla, graham cracker and chocolate overlaid on flavors of cassis and cherry. Clove notes accent fine tannins on the finish.",Reserve,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,"Soft and inviting without being flabby. If more mass-market Merlots were this good the variety wouldn't be so maligned. Mint accents the jammy cherry and mocha flavors, finishing with hints of chocolate and coconut.",Reserve,87,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,"A bit divisive among our panelists, with one finding it rather light and lacking in intensity, while others found virtue in its understated yet varietally correct nature. Cola and cherry flavors finish clean and fresh.",Reserve,87,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gallo Family Vineyards
US,"Here's a soft, plushly textured Merlot, with polished cherry, blackberry and toast flavors and a dry finish. It's a pleasant sipper, and will benefit from decanting before serving to let it breathe and develop.",,85,11,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,L de Lyeth
US,"Dry and gritty in texture, with hard-edged, jagged tannins, this wine is very ripe. It has strong black cherry, blackberry and coffee flavors, and needs to be decanted before serving.",Meritage,84,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Lyeth
US,"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.",,82,13,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gan Eden
US,"Fat fruit, juicy and ripe, brimming with wonderful fruit flavors. The wine is unctuous, sinfully lush, and still balanced with berries and spice and some good toasty oak. Young and hard, but good stuff with a nice life ahead.",Old Vine,91,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Lake Sonoma
US,"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo.",Old Vines,91,25,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis
US,"Young, tight, firm fruit, with nuances of blueberry dominating. Tannic, dry and tight, it's well made with excellent structure and balance. Tight right now, high-toned and tart, but with a good, long life ahead.",San Lorenzo,91,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"Toasty nose, bright fruit, makes for a classy, creamy, zippy Zin. This is really a pleasure, balanced and forward and full of life. There are some nuances of tar and spice in a balanced, exceptionally lively, seductive wine.",Liar's Dice,91,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Murphy-Goode
US,"Old-vine straw, tobacco and herb in the nose. The wine is subtle, sensual and complex, with layers of interesting spicy flavor. Nicely balanced and flavorful, with a long, firm finish.",Century Vines,90,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sausal
US,"Delicious berries and cream nose, which follows through with crisp, spicy flavors and good structure. OVOC stands for “old vines old clones” and the fruit, from head-pruned, hillside vineyards, lives up to its billing. Great all-purpose Zin.",OVOC,90,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alderbrook
US,"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever. It's just plain delicious, old-vine, succulent juice. Jammy, juicy, vibrant and tight, it has a long life ahead.",Geyserville,90,30,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ridge
US,"Good, bright, spicy fruit, with fine balance and a silky, extended finish. There's lovely concentration in the back end, suggesting blackberries and loganberries and plenty of toast.",Home Ranch,89,26,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"Good, tangy red fruit, with youthful vigor and zest. Nuances of citrus rind, cranberry and toast; it's compact and sleek, still young and tight, but perfectly balanced and precision-tuned.",,88,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Grgich Hills
US,"Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak. Finishes dry, with somewhat more discernable blackberry and vanilla notes and moderately puckering tannins. Best for keeping; try in two-plus years.",St. Peter's Church Vineyard,88,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish. The fruit is subsumed to clove and tobacco flavors; best with strongly spiced grilled foods.",Old Vines,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
US,"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors. Well made and approachable, with some added interest from Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre in the blend.",Old Vines,87,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sebastiani
US,"Some of Seghesio's plantings are over a century old, and the wine has a classic, briary quality to it. Supple and inviting, it drinks well now but has the balance and structure to age for a few years.",Old Vine,87,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
US,"Firm, fruity, with tropical flavors and lots of alcohol. The flavors are tight and contained, the fruit tends to strawberry, and the finish is tannic.",,86,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Windsor
US,"Forward, fruity and clean, with a jokey label showing a moose, an elk and a sheep playing pool. This wine would make a great house Zin if the price were just a tad lower.",Eighth Rack,86,14,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Meeker
US,"Smooth style, with lots of vanilla cream and ripe berry fruit. Forward, inviting style of wine, with light tannins and a clean, focused finish. It's well balanced and professionally made, but ultimately unexciting.",,86,19,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,La Crema
US,"This is the first wine from this new winery. Clean, light berry fruit is the whole show, and it's a forward, fruity Zin with friendly, simple flavors.",Cervina,85,22,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Venus
US,"Full berry cocoa and pepper aromas on the nose open to solid black cherry and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is big, but there's fairly high acidity, too, and some big tannins with a decided bite on the back end.  The elements are there in this dense and chunky wine; only time will tell if they come into greater harmony.",,85,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"Starts out nice, with a good, fruity raspberry nose, but on the palate are tastes of tomatoes, with a dry, astringent, tannic finish.",Wallstrum Family,83,20,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Newlan
US,"Simple and fruity and forward, though still unbalanced from extreme youth. It's more like a Beaujolais nouveau, with an odd, disjointed, watery finish. The price seems way out of line for what's in the bottle.",Sin Zin,82,18,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,"This wine become pretty pricey but that's because consumers recognize its quality; its sheer deliciousness can't be beat. It has all the elements of fine Russian River Pinot—it's dry and has lots o f ripe fruit, pretty oak, toast and spice—and it puts them all together in a super-elegant package. The vintage is light but the wine doesn't seem to mind. Its class shows. `",Thomas Road Vineyard,90,50,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
US,"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef.",Meritage,90,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"This ripe, lovely wine shows classic Russian River Valley aromas of ripe, sweet, green apples. The winemaking adds smoky, vanilla-scented oak, a creamy, leesy smoothness and a rich softness that owes to malolactic fermentation. What strikes you, though, is the balance. All the parts come together in this super-enjoyable wine. At this price, it's a great value.",,89,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kenwood
US,"Here's a Pinot Blanc that's not a Chardonnay lookalike, with its melange of wildflower and tropical fruit aromas. There's something almost Rhône-like in the opulence of its flavors, with chocolate, honey, brown-crushed spice and nectarines in a crisp wine with a long finish. It misses a few points because of a certain lack of complexity, but flavor freaks won't be disappointed by this jolting wine.",,88,15,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon
US,"Enough berry and plum richness and smoky oak to satisfy fussy drinkers, yet dry and compact, with a nice shine of acidity. Not too complex or subtle, but there's plenty to like about it. Should be easy to find with more than 30,000 cases produced.",,87,17,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"If you didn't know the price and had to guess, you'd probably figure this wine would cost about $18. It's enormously ripe and fruity, with bright peach, tropical fruits and spices and quite a bit of oak. The technical notes say it was partially barrel-fermented. A wine of enormous charm and a great value in Chardonnay.",,86,10,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dreyer Sonoma
US,"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity. Some pretty flavors here, with lots of spice and soft tannins. Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.",,85,21,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.",Reserve,84,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois
US,"You can call this Pinot thin, or you can call it elusive. While it does show the lean profile of the 2011 vintage, it's quite complex, offering high acid-inspired flavors of raspberry sour candy, chamomile tea and cranberries, plus minerally, dried herb complexities. Drinking through 2020.",Van Der Kamp Vineyard,91,42,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Follette
US,"A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot, this was built to be approachable young. Grapes are sourced from an estate, organically farmed vineyard as well as two neighboring properties, Pickberry and Murray Ranch. Tobacco forms around a juiciness of blackberry and raspberry, giving it a sultry edge, while maintaing soft tannins throughout.",Counterpoint,90,40,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen
US,"The blend is Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. The wine is full-bodied, dry and tannic, and not showing well now, despite a wealth of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, grilled meat and black pepper flavors. It's fancy in oak and feels lush, but those tannins are stubborn. Age until at least 2022.",Richard Donner Vineyards Proprietary,90,42,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Red Blend,Rocky Hill

US,"Lush with fruit and bright with acidity, this tasty Pinot Noir features upfront flavors of raspberries, cola, red currants accented with cedar and exotic spices. It's dry and mouth-filling, and should gradually shed fruit for earthiness as it matures over the next six years.",Silver Pines Vineyard,91,38,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bailiwick
US,"Virtually identical with Pinot Noir, and quite a good one at that. Shows cool-climate influence in the translucent color, vital acidity and pure flavors of raspberries and persimmons, accented with smoky oak.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,24,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Meunier,Novy

US,"Dry and tannic in youth, this Cabernet shows a cool-climate influence in the earthiness and minerality that frame the black currant and oak flavors. It's a good wine, with a good structure. Give it a few hours of decanting and drink soon.",Reserve,89,45,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray

US,"Laurel Glen's second wine, and no slouch. This vintage brings a richly textured, deeply flavored Cab as good as many costing far more. Ripe flavors of currants are wrapped in toasty oak, with firm but plush tannins. Will age through the decade and improve. A good value.",Counterpoint,91,25,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen
US,"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it.

US,"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,42,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Made from biodynamically grown estate grapes, this Cabernet-based wine is as massive as any I've tasted from this great vintage. It's like drinking liquid steel, with deep, ripe flavors of blackcurrants, chocolate and cherries, and plenty of new oak.

US,"Tight and brittle now, with acidity and dryness starring. The thing to understand about this Pinot is that it's quite modest in alcohol and understated in flavor, showing rhubarb, pomegranate and cherry Lifesaver flavors with a minerally edge. Elegant now, it should develop over the next six years.",Silver Pines Vineyard,92,44,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bailiwick
US,"A very successful Cabernet that continues the winery's string of mountain bottlings. It's dry and classically balanced, with a firm minerality bracing flavors of blackberries, black currants, herbs, spices and smoky oak. The firm tannins are a bit numbing now, so give it 3 or 4 years in the cellar to settle down.",,92,45,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
US,"An interesting Pinot Noir, showing a bit of heat, but whose flavors are taut and complex. The usual cherries and cola you find in almost all California Pinot Noirs are grounded with meaty notes, like grilled hamburger, finished with a splash of tamari. Such are the tannins and acids that the wine should age gracefully for a good eight years, but you can drink it now.",van der Kamp Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
US,"Ripe, forward blackberry, cherry, currant and licorice flavors mark this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend. It's dry, and the tannins are ultrarefined. But there's an astringent feeling that shuts down the palate's appreciation of how good it is. This is a wine you want to cellar for 4–6 years.",Tribute,90,80,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Benziger
US,"The wild raspberry and cherry fruit is starting to drop out from this five-year-old wine, leaving behind alcohol and acidity. Turns astringent on the finish. Hard to see it improving with more age, but it's interesting for a certain complex tension.",Moonridge Vineyards,87,35,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Merlot,Korbin Kameron
US,"Earns its high score by virtue of sheer power. Just explodes in the mouth with raspberry and cherry fruit, as well as spicy complexities of cola, red licorice and smoky oak. Dry and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, it's a little brawny now, but should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",Van Der Kamp Vineyard,93,40,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Follette
US,"Soft and layered, this wine has firmness and depth to its structure, and is dark in brooding baked plum and cinnamon stick. A pungency of tight oak wraps its way around the fruit and savory spice, suggesting additional time in cellar, through 2023.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,91,49,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"From the only estate in Sonoma County growing the variety, this full-bodied white was aged in a combination of neutral French oak and stainless steel.

US,"A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot, this was built to be approachable young. Grapes are sourced from an estate, organically farmed vineyard as well as two neighboring properties, Pickberry and Murray Ranch.

US,"Lush with fruit and bright with acidity, this tasty Pinot Noir features upfront flavors of raspberries, cola, red currants accented with cedar and exotic spices. It's dry and mouth-filling, and should gradually shed fruit for earthiness as it matures over the next six years.",Silver Pines Vineyard,91,38,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bailiwick
US,"This is a new, low-production designation, a selected barrel reserve, from Laurel Glen's new owners. The wine shows an exuberance resulting from the influence of consulting winemaker David Ramey. Massive blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, wrapped into Sonoma Mountain's strong tannins, make the wine an ideal cellar candidate. Drink 2018 and beyond.",The Laureate,94,85,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen

US,"Inky black in hue, this wine is enormously tannic, which gives it a mouth-numbing astringency. Along with the structure, it has a gigantic, sweet-tasting core of blackberry jam and currant flavors, which breaks through the bitterness.

US,"This is a big, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, stuffed with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, red licorice and oak. It's impressive for its sheer volume, with zippy acidity that helps balance the high alcohol. It needs a few hours in the decanter to round off the edges, and it should hold in the bottle for several years.",,89,55,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Aiken
US,"An excellent Pinot Noir that's consistent with Talisman's recent string of successes. The wine is rich in acidity and complex, with earthy, mushroomy flavors of cherries and sweet raspberries.

US,"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal.

Should be nice with roast salmon, lamb chops or a great grilled steak.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,45,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vergari
US,"Stunning. Combines the fleshy opulence of a sweetly youthful Pinot with the balanced tightness and acidity of a young, cellar-worthy one. No small feat!

Gorgeous now, and should improve for six years before slowly bowing out.",Silver Pines Vineyard,94,54,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering.

US,"Very tannic, in the Laurel Glen way, this young wine's toughness is due to the estate vineyard's mountain terroir. In years past, Laurel Glen was a cult Cabernet. They perhaps dropped the ball for a while, but this wine stages a big comeback. It's rich and vital in black currant and mineral, with just the right touch of new oak, and it shows a sophistication not seen from the winery in years. And at this price, it's a bargain.

US,"It's hard to consistently get scores this high year after year, but Greg Bjornstad does, because he understands Pinot Noir. Specifically, he knows how to combine power, which is easy, with finesse, which isn't. This 2007, from an esteemed vineyard, is spectacular in wild forest cherry, cola, licorice, pine cone, anise, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors, even as it's perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, fine tannins and just-right oak. Lovely and complex. Now–2014.",van der Kamp Vineyard,96,40,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad

US,"An enormously fruity wine that seems to trade subtlety for sheer exuberance. Offers gigantic flavors of raspberry granola candy bar, cherry liqueur, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast, and although that sounds sweet, the wine is fully dry, with crisp coastal acidity and finely ground tannins. Hard to see how it will age, but delicious now and for a couple years.",Silver Pines Vineyard,89,42,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"A terrific Cabernet from this mountain west of Sonoma Valley.

US,"A worthy followup to the magnificent 2005. Feels lush and dramatic in the mouth, with softly refined tannins and herb-tinged flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis, mocha and smoky oak. Dramatic and impressive. Drink now through 2016.",,93,55,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peters Family
US,"This is a very rich, dry and concentrated Cabernet, but it's also very tannic. The blackberry, blueberry, cherry and currant flavors are wrapped into tight, hard tannins. Should develop in the bottle over the next six years, but it will always be somewhat tannic. Give it a good decant before serving.",Reserve,90,45,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
US,"Ripe, forward blackberry, cherry, currant and licorice flavors mark this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend. It's dry, and the tannins are ultrarefined. But there's an astringent feeling that shuts down the palate's appreciation of how good it is. This is a wine you want to cellar for 4–6 years.",Tribute,90,80,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Benziger
US,"The vineyard, in the little-known appellation of Sonoma Mountain, is source to many wineries, and quality has varied. In Tandem's hands, it has produced a magnificent wine, rich, dry and balanced. Pale in color, with crisp acidity and a smoothly tannic structure, it shows opulent flavors of cherries, persimmons, cola and sweet, smoky oak, with earthy, mushroomy complexities. Brilliant now, and should develop for several years.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,93,48,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"This Sonoma Mountain appellation is becoming increasingly important for Pinot Noir, thanks to bottlings like this. The wine is amazingly powerful in black cherry, raspberry, rosehip tea, licorice, cola and vanilla oak flavors. Yet crisp acidity and silky smooth tannins make it balanced and elegant. Defines a certain California, drink-me-now style.",Silver Pines Vineyard,93,60,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"There's a good crunch of mouthwatering acidity on this wine, like biting into a green apple or slice of pineapple, both of whose flavors are here, along with gooseberries and a distinct taste of nutmeg. The wine is very dry. Creaminess adds needed richness, but it's still a tart wine.",Farina Vineyard,87,22,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Tres Sabores
US,"Tight, tannic and bone dry, this ultralow production wine comes from the small, somewhat obscure Sonoma Mountain appellation. It aims high, with the Northern Rhône the model. The blackberry and black currant flavors have an edge of smoky oak. Judging from the way the wine gains interest in the glass as it warms, it should have a fine future.",,91,28,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Syrah,Verve
US,"One-dimensional and tannic, this Syrah has cherry and blackberry pulp and mocha flavors, with notes of anise, cinnamon and vanilla. It's like a Starbucks drink, but dry.",Janian Mountain,84,28,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Syrah,Esterlina
US,"The wild raspberry and cherry fruit is starting to drop out from this five-year-old wine, leaving behind alcohol and acidity. Turns astringent on the finish. Hard to see it improving with more age, but it's interesting for a certain complex tension.",Moonridge Vineyards,87,35,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Merlot,Korbin Kameron
US,"A shade too ripe, with a raisiny edge to the blackberries, cherries and chocolate. This 100% varietal Cab also feels soft and hot. But the tannins are wonderfully rich and fine.",Reserve,85,60,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
US,"Silky smooth, dry and classy, this Pinot shows great coastal personality in its tannins, crisp acidity and ripe flavors of cherries, cola, raspberries, pomegranates, orange zest and sweet rhubarb. That acidity is fresh and tart. Doesn't seem likely to improve, so decant. Should be nice with roast salmon, lamb chops or a great grilled steak.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,45,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vergari
US,"A very rich Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but quite tannic. You want to give it some time in the cellar. Dry and full-bodied, it shows ripe, deep flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, dark chocolate and anise, with smoky overtones from oak. Feels dramatic and impressive. Give it until 2012 to come around.",Cuvée Kristin,93,55,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Korbin Kameron
US,"Rarely bottled on its own, Pinot Meunier is better known as a blending component for Champagne. This bottling is like a Pinot Noir in its lightly silky texture and cherry, cola and vanilla flavors. It's very elegant, yet doesn't quite rise to the classic status of Pinot Noir.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,87,60,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Meunier,Tandem
US,"It's hard to consistently get scores this high year after year, but Greg Bjornstad does, because he understands Pinot Noir. Specifically, he knows how to combine power, which is easy, with finesse, which isn't. This 2007, from an esteemed vineyard, is spectacular in wild forest cherry, cola, licorice, pine cone, anise, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors, even as it's perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, fine tannins and just-right oak. Lovely and complex. Now–2014.",van der Kamp Vineyard,96,40,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad
US,"Quite a noble, interesting wine that bears comparing with the best of Napa Valley. It's bone dry, with softly dusty tannins backed with a firm hit of clean acidity. The flavors are somewhat herbal, with a sage and tobacco edge to the blackberries, dark chocolate and graphite. Feels classy and important, but young. Better after 2012.",Pickberry Vineyards,94,50,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Ravenswood
US,"Well oaked, with a toasty, vanilla-infused cream and caramel edge, this polished Chard has peach custard flavors dusted with cinnamon, nutmeg and candied ginger. It's delicious and complex. The word “rich” doesn't begin to do it justice.",Pugash Vineyard,92,45,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mi Sueño
US,"Very ripe and jammy in raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, this Pinot is accented with crisp acidity. Oak barrel aging adds notes of caramel and buttered toast. It's a deliciously dry wine, although a bit direct and obvious. Seems at its best now and for 3–4 years.",van der Kamp Vineyard,90,46,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"An enormously fruity wine that seems to trade subtlety for sheer exuberance. Offers gigantic flavors of raspberry granola candy bar, cherry liqueur, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast, and although that sounds sweet, the wine is fully dry, with crisp coastal acidity and finely ground tannins. Hard to see how it will age, but delicious now and for a couple years.",Silver Pines Vineyard,89,42,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Shows classic cool coastal Pinot Noir characteristics of light-bodied, silky smooth tannins, crisp acidity and delightful flavors of ripe raspberries, red cherries, cola and spices. A little one-dimensional, but totally drinkable.",Grand Detour Van der Kamp Vineyards,88,30,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
US,"Classic Laurel Glen, a Cabermet stuffed with dense, thrillingly ripe fruit, yet surrounded by dusty mountain tannins that warrant cellaring. The flavors are as intricate as a tapestry, weaving together black currants, blueberries, plums, cocoa, macaroons, spices and sweet oak. Thoroughly dry, this is great Laurel Glen. Decant now; drinkable through at least 2015.",,95,55,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen
US,"Stunning. Combines the fleshy opulence of a sweetly youthful Pinot with the balanced tightness and acidity of a young, cellar-worthy one. No small feat! From a cool vintage in a cool appellation that's increasingly known for Pinot Noir, the wine is pale in color and delicate in the mouth, yet powerful in cherry-cola and spice intensity. Gorgeous now, and should improve for six years before slowly bowing out.",Silver Pines Vineyard,94,54,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Benziger pulls out all the stops on this estate, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, from their hilly vineyard above Glen Ellen. It's a beautiful effort. The flavors are very close to Napa Cab, namely deliciously sweet cassis, roasted coffee and cocoa, but there's a tannin and acid structure that in some respects outclasses even Napa's most prestigious chateaus. This is a great red wine.",Tribute,94,65,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Benziger
US,"Brilliantly sharp, penetrating Sauvignon. Opens with intense aromas of gooseberry, grapefruit juice, lime, apricot, tart green apple and white pepper, leading to a rich, very dry, high-acid wine of great depth, charm and complexity. From the cool, long vintage of 2005, it is simply great Sauvignon Blanc.",Paradiso de Maria,92,29,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Benziger
US,"Soft, oaky and gentle, this shows cherry, raspberry and cola flavors that are on the jammy side. Almost overripe, it's a dry, stylish wine.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,86,48,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"From the minute you sniff this wine, you like it, an impression that grows stronger from the first sip through the finish. It's dry, peppery-fruity and firm in acids and tannins, with a distinguished mouthfeel. Not an ager, but a brilliant, evocative expression of cool-climate Syrah.",Janian Vineyard,92,25,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Syrah,Esterlina
US,"This is the first commercial reserve wine Patrick Campbell has released in more than 20 years of winemaking, and it is indeed something special. Young and dense now, with firm tannins and acidity, and a richly explosive, meaty core of blackcurrant and cassis fruit. Completely authoritative. Campbell is at the top of his game with this marvelous, ageworthy wine. Drinkable now, but best aged through the decade.",Reserve,94,75,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen
US,"This is a very fine Sauvignon Blanc that has great elegance and finesse as well as power. To begin with, it's delicately structured, with a steely minerality and fine acidity, and is fully dry. The flavors are a mélange of lime, alfalfa, honeydew melon, fig and white pepper.",Paradiso de Maria,91,27,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Benziger
US,"The appellation is little known because so few wines bear it, but Cabs from here, notably Laurel Glen's, are notoriously long-lived. This wine is right there in terms of ageability. It's enormously strong in tannins now, and bone dry, offering only hints of what it could be. But it's a powerful, masculine wine that should hit its stride after 2010 and hold for another decade.",Reserve,91,60,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
US,"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,42,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Laurel Glen's second wine, and no slouch. This vintage brings a richly textured, deeply flavored Cab as good as many costing far more. Ripe flavors of currants are wrapped in toasty oak, with firm but plush tannins. Will age through the decade and improve. A good value.",Counterpoint,91,25,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen
US,"Black fruit with a touch of prune and meat on the nose. Oak-lashed plums and currants in the mouth taste a bit burnt from the wood treatment. A woody express train, with lots of coffee. Fans of dark, structured, oaky wines will get a kick out of this one.",,89,50,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,August Briggs
US,"Like autumn in a bottle, the subdued smoke and pear bouquet is followed by a buttered apple, toast and vanilla palate. The flavors are more understated than they sound—this wine is all about subtlety and balance. It builds in layers, complex and butter-smooth. The standout finish shows butterscotch and mineral notes in a delightful tension.",Richard Dinner Vineyard,90,47,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paul Hobbs

US,"Given about a year in French oak, less than half of it new, this is a cohesive blend of 53% Grenache, 29% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and 6% Counoise.

The acidity is medium to high, while the tannins are rough and chewy, suggesting the need for assimilation time.",Serres Ranch,87,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Highway 12
US,"A brand new vineyard designation for the winery, Bedrock dates to the 1800s and is being made famous by proprietor Joel Peterson of Ravenswood and his son, Morgan Twain Peterson. This wine does the site justice, a smooth concoction of cherry pit and allspice, elegant and yet plenty generous in fruit and structure, measured by natural acidity.",Bedrock Vineyard,92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Robert Biale
US,"Syrah dominates the blend on this dry, complex red wine. It brings tannins and deep flavors of blackberries and charred meat. One-third of Grenache adds lightness and cherries, while oak contributes the perfect note of toast. The alcohol is high, but it never feels hot, just mouth-filling and warming. It's a polished and complex wine that brings to mind a perfect steak.",Cuvée Alis,91,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style Red Blend,Amapola Creek

US,"The fact that this variety is still in the ground in the county says something; the fact that's it's still in the confines of Pagani Ranch says even more. In this ode to generations gone by, the grower and winemaker find common ground in showcasing a big-bodied, black-purple expression of fig, plum and grippy leather that lands softly on the palate.",Pagani Ranch,90,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Alicante Bouschet,Carlisle

US,"This powerful Cabernet Sauvignon calls on 13% Malbec to further its brawn, the mix spending two years in entirely new French oak. Hugely muscular, it needs time to calm its masterfully ripe fruit and dark layers of clove spice, and to further soften its tannins and coax out the shy component of herb.

US,"This bottling is typical of the style of Zin this vineyard produces. It's very high in alcohol, soft in acids, firm in tannins, and luscious with blackberry, cherry and milk chocolate flavor. Palls after a few sips due to its glyceriney richness.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,85,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Muscardini
US,There's a pretty pink “eye of the partridge” color on this blush wine. Brisk acidity makes the finish clean and minerally. The strawberry and vanilla flavors finish just slightly off dry.,Alice's Vineyards Rosato,85,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Muscardini

US,"Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks.

Acidity is balanced and the bouquet quite floral, with the palate devoted to brioche and golden honey.",Durell Vineyard Origin,93,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Three Sticks

US,"This is a big, lusty, fruit-forward wine. It shows Barbera's tannins, although they're soft and just need a steak to balance them out. The flavors are of rich, ripe blackberries and cherries. It's pretty much as elegant as Barbera gets, considering it is usually rather rustic in California.",,89,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Sebastiani

US,"This richly flavorful wine is smoky and lush, with hints of cassis and black cherry and dusty spices. It is very dry, with soft, easy but complex tannins, and leaves a lingering aftertaste.

US,"This is a strange style of Claifornia Viognier, but an interesting one.  The usual flower and fruit notes are undercut by much drier, tart notes of acidity.  It's as if the winemaker wanted to make a leaner style of wine.  It succeeds, but at the cost of losing varietal character.  It's fresh and clean but easy to mistake for Sauvignon Blanc.",,84,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,La Crema

US,"Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness.

US,"The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent.

US,"A percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended into this Merlot to give structure around its otherwise soft, round and lingering combination of dark candied plum, cinnamon and cedar.

US,"Flowers, melon and stone fruit inform the aromas and flavors of this unctuous, weighty and viscous wine, smooth with a lingering taste of ripe peach on the finish. Tiny percentages of Riesling and Gewürztraminer figure into the mix, too.",The Party Starter,87,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,FlyWine
US,"This high altitude vineyard reliably produces enormously ripe fruit with correspondingly giant alcohol and tannin levels. The palate is full of chocolate-covered raisin and blackberry jam flavors, but it's a little over the top.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,86,53,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna
US,"A late-harvest blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Sémillon from a good year for botrytis, this is dark gold in color. It offers sweet, lush and satisfying swaths of dried apple and orange that linger on the palate, finished with a drop of honey.",Sweet Leslie Late Harvest,90,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Kunde
US,"A Cabernet with 12% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot blended in, all from Sonoma Valley's Rancho Salina Vineyard, this wine is medium in weight and viscous. A nice mix of cedar and herbs play against savory cranberry and tobacco. The balanced acidity gives it a lift.",Heritage Reserve,88,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"Almost clear in color and faintly aromatic, it offers nuanced layers of pineapple, guava and pear. A suggestion of barrel fermentation makes it mid-weight and fuller in body. The finish is creamy and swathed in herb, an ideal companion to shellfish.",Uboldi Vineyard,88,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,St. Francis
US,"Impressive for its power, a wine of considerable interest and complexity. It's rich in black cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spice flavors, but the texture really stands up, a combination of firm tannins and brilliant acidity. Oak provides complicating notes of sweet toast. Drink soon.",Exuberance,88,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Canihan
US,"Sanguine in black olive tapenade, this is a soft, smooth, 100% varietal wine that's full-bodied and expressive in black cherry and dark plum. It finishes in tight, chewy tannins.",Caton Vineyard Upper Bench,87,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Ty Caton
US,"Extraordinarily high alcohol is the defining reality of this wine. It gives it a burn in the mouth, like cognac, only without the richness. The currant and spice flavors are nicely dry, but that high alcohol accentuates the tannins.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,85,53,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna
US,"A delicate study in Golden Delicious apple and ginger undertones, this wine is also hearty in toast and oak, concentrated and rich with a clean finish of vanilla and hazelnut. A good call with buttery seafood like fresh-caught lobster.",Wild Oak Vineyard,88,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
US,"Ripe with cherries, mocha, currants and oak, you'll be tempted to drink this now. Don't. While it's not a long-term ager, it will benefit from 4–5 years in a good cellar.",Signaterra Three Blocks,91,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Benziger
US,"Few Cabs in the world are this ripe and balanced. It floods the mouth with flavors of cherries, red plums, licorice and mocha, along with sumptuous oak notes. It's delicious enough to drink now, but the firm tannins suggest 6–8 years of aging.",Signaterra Sunny Slope,91,66,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Benziger
US,"This wine, made from biodynamically-grown grapes, as good as any Sonoma Valley Bordeaux blend has ever been. It's exceptionally ripe and pure with blackberries, cherries, currants and mocha, while oak brings rich notes of toast. It's quite tannic now, so you'll want to cellar it for 5–6 years.",Tribute,91,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Benziger
US,"Elegant in subtle fruit and earthy spice, this medium-bodied wine aims for elegance despite a hearty imprint of oak. The winery has amped up its Pinot game with this vintage, reflecting its Sonoma Valley roots in this particular selection.",Geza's Selection,88,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Buena Vista
US,"Winemaker Ehren Jordan makes this wine with purchased single-vineyard fruit from old vines.

Drink it over the next few years.",Chuy,90,58,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
US,"Light in color and body and modest in alcohol at 12%, this is a curiously intriguing Grenache, tightly wound in freshly picked strawberries and an undeniable earthiness. Aromas lean toward roses with a heavy hint of menthol. A touch of pepperiness on the finish completes the wine.",Ceja Farms,87,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Grenache,Sheldon

US,"Seemingly sweet and oaky, this has buttered popcorn, buttered toast and caramel cream flavors. The fruit suggests pineapples and pears.",Kinneybrook Vineyard,85,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"Overripe, juicy and soft, this has baked fruit flavors, like blackberries and cherries in a pie. Oak adds to the sweetness with sugary caramel. It's rich, but it lacks complexity and ageworthiness.",Rancho Salina,85,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Muscardini
US,"This very dry Cabernet feels rugged and gritty in the mouth, with too much acidity that lends bite. The austerity is relieved by black cherry and sweet tobacco flavors. Drink up.",Madrone Ridge Vineyard,85,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Muscardini
US,"Briny, thick and gravelly, this is a blend of 42% Roussanne, 20% Grenache Blanc, 20% Picpoul Blanc and 18% Marsanne, fermented half in neutral French oak and half in stainless steel. High-toned acidity and citrus wrap around salty, herbal undertones, finishing crisp and light.",Turbine White,88,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Anaba
US,"Soft, fruity and spicy, this Zinfandel is starting to pick up some bottle-age notes. The currant and black raspberry flavors are joined by sautéed mushroom and charred bone accents. The rich tannins suggest pairing it with roasted or barbecued meats.",Meeks Hilltop Ranch,90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"This wine has a plethora of green pepper going on, and not in a particularly pleasant way.",,80,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hannah Nicole Vineyards
US,"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",,95,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"With Pinot Noir, the magic trick is to have it taste sweet and ripe, and yet to finish bone dry. Few wineries in California accomplish this as regularly as Hanzell, and here they come again, with this wonderful 2008. It's entirely consistent with their past history, being dry, a little tannic and tantalizingly rich in cherry, raspberry and cola fruit. Enjoyable now, with decanting, and should develop in the cellar over the next dozen years if not longer, based on the winery's track record.",,94,95,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell

Easy to drink with ham, bacon, sausage and other salty, umami-rich meats.",Wisdom,87,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,B Wise
US,"A mix of 37% Zinfandel, 32% Syrah and 31% Petite Sirah, this is a burly, thick and syrupy concoction from a high-elevation vineyard site known for its power and concentration. Sweet vanilla rides a dense wave of tannin and oak, finishing tight and leathery.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Mountain,86,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Louis M. Martini
US,"Very tannic and gritty now. Shuts the fruit down with a dry, sandpapery astringency. But what great fruit. It's rich in blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and mocha, and is bone dry. Could and should age, but there's a certain sharpness that makes you wonder.",Anthem,88,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,St. Francis
US,"The winery calls this brand new bottling a declassification of the estate Chardonnay, by barrel elimination. It's not quite as dramatic as their '09 estate, but, at half the price, it's a great buy. Dry, crisp and minerally, with citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors, it's an elegant, Chablis-style Chard to drink now.",Sebella,91,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell

US,"Very ripe, with a bite of raisin skin bitterness. But it's a lush wine, filled with chocolate, blueberry, blackberry jam and cedar flavors that go down nice and easy. Drink now.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bonneau
US,"Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core. The fruit is so ripely expansive, it tastes sweet on the finish, yet the wine is utterly dry. It's good now despite the hard mountain tannins, but should begin to blossom after 2014.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,91,54,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",Cuvée Kristin Estate Blend,91,55,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Korbin Kameron
US,"An earthy Merlot, this has tobacco and dried sage flavors, plus black cherry and currant notes. It's dry and tannic, but it's not one to age. Let it breathe for at least 30 minutes before serving.",,87,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Schug
US,"A very nice Zin, lusty and rich, with ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, smoked meat and dusty baking spices. It's a big wine whose fruits and tannins suggest pairing with smoky barbecue.",Montecillo Vineyard,90,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Keating

US,"A rich, viscous combination of 55% Roussanne, 35% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this offers a bite of creamy vanilla amidst layered, hearty and concentrated flavors of lemon chiffon. Fermented in oak and stainless steel, it aged for 11 months in French oak, only 28% of it new.",Turbine,90,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Anaba
US,"Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks. The area planted to Old Wente 5 clone contributes zesty acidity and crisp apple; the V9 vineyard block is known for minerality. Acidity is balanced and the bouquet quite floral, with the palate devoted to brioche and golden honey.",Durell Vineyard Origin,93,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Three Sticks

US,"Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now.",Truehart Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Trueheart
US,"There's something lusty about this wine. It's the strong berry, cherry and chocolate flavors, combined with powerful tannins and an immediately delicious umami taste. Seems best now.",MacAllister Vineyard,89,46,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Eponymous
US,"Brisk, dry and clean, this Sauvignon Blanc shows New Zealand-like qualities. It has gooseberry, lemon, lime, white pepper and vanilla flavors, and brisk acidity gives it a mouthwatering tartness.",,86,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wellington
US,"Impenetrably black in color, this Syrah feels bone dry and tannic. It has all of the hallmarks of an ageable wine, but the concentration of blackberry and currant flavors is unlikely to outlast the tannins. Drink this over the next few years.",Englandcrest,86,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Wellington
US,"The mouthfeel is a little gritty and rough in this 100% Syrah. It has a toothpick-like woodiness that likely comes from having aged in 50% new oak. Underneath the oak are flavors of blackberry, leather and anise.",Mountain Terraces Vineyard,86,44,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Shadowbox
US,"This is a strongly flavored Chardonnay. It packs a punch in ripe tropical citrus fruit, pear and vanilla oak flavors that are honey sweet on the finish. The acidity provides balance, but seems awkwardly applied.",Gabriella Ranch,85,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,VJB
US,"Easy to really like this soft, delicious Merlot. It's so rich in black cherries and cassis, with a chocolaty edge and smoky, sweet notes of oak barrels. Not an ager, but one of the fancier Merlots out there.",Pépé Cavedale Vineyards,91,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Y Rousseau

US,"Saintsbury brings a Pinot Noir-like touch to this Syrah. It's silky and transparent, with an elegant mouthfeel, but shows Syrah's weight and depth, with blackberry, blueberry, leather and pepper spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Drink now.",Sawi Vineyard,90,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Saintsbury

US,"The sweetness got out of hand in this wine, which tastes like it has excessive residual sugar. There's a raspberry and white chocolate power bar flavor. That's delicious, of course, but consumers should know the wine isn't dry.",Stellwagen Vineyard,87,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"A beautiful Zinfandel, lusty and smooth, that takes the variety's rustic, wild berry, tobacco, anise, herb and pepper flavors and makes them as elegant as Zinfandel gets. Strong, grippy tannins call for a salty, peppery flank steak.",Jack London Vineyard,90,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood

US,"A very nice 100% Cab that will benefit from 3–5 years in the cellar. Right now, it's locked down in tannins, with an astringent hardness. Yet it's elegantly constructed, with a fine core of black currants and cedar.",Olive Hill Estate Vineyards,88,55,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"A rich, complex, spicy wine whose raspberry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors are forward and flamboyant. It's a little sweet, and probably at its best now, but flashy.",,87,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Trios
US,"Made from equal parts Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, this blend seems to detract from the purity of both. The result is interesting and even dramatic in ripeness, but a little muddied, with hard tannins making it tough despite a rich center of blackberry and cherry jam.",Caudalies Reserve,87,52,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ledson
US,"There's a rustic quality to the tannins, which are chewy and stemmy and not quite ripe. They give a tough mouthfeel to the black cherry, black currant and caramelized oak flavors. Decant before serving.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Petite Verdot,Wellington
US,"This Zinfandel is alcoholic, and it's dominated by overripe prune and raisin flavors.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,80,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Tin Barn
US,"These old vines are famous for concentration, and this Zin surely is one of the most intense wines of the vintage. It's huge in wild berry, currant, licorice, dark chocolate, bacon and exotic spice flavors that go on and on.

US,"The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent. But you'll also easily discover the vast richness of chocolate, cherry, blackberry and currant fruit, so deep and impressive, and the finish is totally dry and balanced. This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,91,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Atmosphere

US,"One of the most successful Bordeaux blends to come out of Sonoma Valley lately, this wine is dry and earthy, providing a nice alternative to today's super-fruity, overripe style.

A polished, pretty wine that could pick up some nuances over the next 2–3 years.",Jack London Vineyard,90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"The vineyard needs a warm vintage to fully ripen, which 2010 definitely wasn't. The wine is acidic and green, with an ammonia edge to the pineapples, mangoes and limes.",Magnolia Lane,85,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
US,"A little heavy and overly extracted. Shows lots of ripe blackberries and black cherries, but fruit isn't everything. It's a wine that needs more levels of complexity.",,85,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you.

US,"This Zin is made in the St. Francis style of dryness at the cost of extremely high alcohol. It's a good, lusty wine made for drinking with rich fare that will counter-balanced the heat. The flavors of blackberries, currants and peppery spices are very rich.",Montecillo Vineyard Kaarin's Terrace,86,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis

Drink now with Vietnamese food or sushi.",Denmark Street Vineyard Tribute,88,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Atmosphere
US,"Whole-cluster pressed and aged in barrel and stainless steel, this is fruity in ripe apricot and pear. It's medium-bodied, meaty but not overdone, with zingy acidity. More creamy than crisp, it lingers on the tongue and makes for a good food wine.",Landa Vineyard,87,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Anaba
US,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",Reserve,88,33,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"Very rich, spicy and full-bodied for a rosé. The raspberry and strawberry flavors have a grilled, caramelized quality, making for a slightly sweet finish.

US,"Distinctive as always, this is another powerful Zinfandel from Martini, which has a long history with this mountain vineyard.

US,"Very good for its complexity, although it's tough and tannic, and the acidity sticks out. The blackberry, currant and cherry flavors are rich and nuanced, but the wine feels hard and sharp. Odds are the lifespan is six years: cellar or decant.",Three Blocks,87,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Signaterra Benziger

US,"Good and dry. Trades richness for a certain aloof elegance, and while it could be denser in fruit, the blackberry, currant and mocha flavors are just fine. Drink now. Production was 16,130 cases.",Jack London Vineyard,87,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"A gorgeous dessert wine. Supersweet in honey, apricot jam, orange blossom, crème brûlée and vanilla flavors, it's balanced with rich acidity, and finishes with a spicy touch of smoke. Compelling and addictive, this is one of the best sweet wines of the year.",Late Harvest,95,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sémillon,Longboard
US,"This is a soft, semi-sweet wine with rich flavors of cherry and raspberry jam, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. It's a little syrupy. Give it a chill in the fridge before drinking.",Estate Vineyard,86,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Tempranillo,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"Tastes its best now, with jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, and a rich overlay of oak. The tannins and acids are soft and gentle.",Caton Vineyard,86,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ty Caton
US,"Fruity, dry and immediately appealing, showing ripe raspberry, cherry, blackberry, cola, licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Could use greater complexity, especially at this price. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Syrah and Malbec.",Tytanium,86,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ty Caton
US,"Feels dry and rustic in the mouth, with astringent tannins and acidity cutting across flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, red currants, licorice and pepper. Best now, with a brief decant.",Caton Vineyard Upper Bench,85,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Ty Caton
US,"This is a big, powerful Zinfandel that's typical of Monte Rosso in its mountain intensity of fruit. It tastes like the essence of ripe blackberries and sweet black currants, with lots of heat from the alcohol. Drink this robust, lusty wine with barbecue and rich meat stews.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,87,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Black Stallion
US,"Tastes thick, old and tired, losing cherry and raspberry fruit and leaving behind vegetal notes. Not going anywhere.",,83,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Canihan
US,"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness.",Los Chamizal Vineyards,85,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hopper Creek
US,"Good, rich notes in this blackberry, currant, dark chocolate, roasted meat and black pepper flavored wine, with its firm tannins. Loses points for excessive softness and heat, which gives it a rustic feel. Drink now.",Caton Vineyard Ballfield,84,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Ty Caton
US,"The oak sticks out, showing sweetly caramelized wood notes that dominate everything underneath. The basic wine seems quite fine, showing black currant flavors wrapped into firm, dry mountain tannins. Could develop, but right now it's unbalanced and heavy.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,87,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
US,"Dry and spicy, with some peppery heat throughout, this massively structured Zin is packed with superripe blackberry, black cherry, dark chocolate, cola, dusty spice and anisette flavors. It's a big, bold wine that calls for similar food.",Los Chamizal Vineyard Morning Sun,87,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"Sweet and sour, like a Chinese pineapple sauce, and there's an ammonia taste that detracts. On the plus side there's mouthwatering acidity and a clean finish.",,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Highway 12
US,"Too soft for comfort. Lacks structural integrity and lively acidity to balance out the rich blackberry, currant, anise and cocoa flavors, and there's peppery heat from high alcohol. Drink now.",Caton Vineyard,84,44,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Ty Caton
US,"High alcohol gives this wine prickly, peppery heat. Although it's dry, it's Port-like, with raisin, blackberry, white pepper, licorice and bacon flavors. Give it credit for sheer power. It will age, without ever losing its rustic character.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Block E44,87,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
US,"Made in the style of an old field blend, this Zin is at least 75% varietal, but the balance could be anything among 14 other grapes. The wine is tannic, peppery and rich in currant and chocolate flavors, with high alcohol. Seems a pace or two behind more recent vintages.",Old Hill,87,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"Briary and brambly are the words that describe this Zin. It's dry and tannic, with wild forest berry, root beer, herb and spice flavors, and a brawniness that hollers out for barbecue.",Barricia,86,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"A lovely Cabernet. It comes from the winery's vineyard in the far southern part of the valley, not far from the Carneros line. The wine is medium-bodied, dry, silky and elegantly tannic, with complex cherry, currant, cola and cedar flavors. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",Cherryblock,92,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"This Cabernet doesn't show any signs of age, even though it's more than four years old. It's still fresh and powerful in tannins, with intensely concentrated blackberry and cassis fruit. With an impeccable structure, it should easily negotiate the next decade. Cellar it.",Monte Rosso,92,70,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"Made from Haywood's estate in Sonoma Valley, this red wine shows the balance and medium body of a fine Merlot, but with Zin's brawny, briary personality. It's a little sweet with pie-filling black cherry, currant and chocolate flavors, and very spicy.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,86,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"Rich in tannins, and direct in fruit-forward blackberry, cherry and black raspberry jam flavors with a chocolaty sweetness, this Cab is ready to drink now and for the next several years.",Los Chamazal Vineyard,86,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Deerfield Ranch
US,"With a smooth mouthfeel and firm, hard tannins, this Cab is ripe in blackberry and black cherry flavors, with notes of sweet fresh herbs and oak. It's a bit hard and bitter now, but could improve in the bottle.",Estate,86,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Petroni
US,"Shows beautifully thick, chewy tannins and ripe, intricate wild berry, currant, pepper and herb flavors. Turns a bit sweet and medicinal on the finish, though, with a taste like Lifesaver candies or cherry cough medicine.",Los Chamizal Vineyard Rocky Terrace,85,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"A lush, soft Cab Franc, if a little one-dimensional. Shows pleasant cherry, herb and cedar flavors, wrapped into firm tannins, and the finish is totally dry. Drink now.",MacAllister Vineyard,87,46,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Eponymous
US,"Enormously rich, a powerhouse Syrah packed with ripe red and black currant, cassis, blueberry, chocolate, coffee, cedar and spice flavors. The structure earns the wine extra points, with ultra-refined tannins and crisp acidity. Decadent, and at its best now, in its flashy youth.",Marco DiGiulio,93,100,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lookout Ridge
US,"With rich, fine tannins and a grilled meat edge to the blackberry, currant and black pepper flavors, this bone-dry Syrah offers lots of pleasure. If it were more concentrated, the score would soar, but still, it's a pretty elegant wine.",,87,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Bump Wine Cellars
US,"A little soft and direct, with jammy, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, tangerines, pears and apricots. Drink now.",Cuvée Natalie Estate,85,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nicholson Ranch
US,"This shows a tart, green gooseberry flavor that is similar to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Other notes include tropical fruit, orange and honey. Unoaked, with a splash of Muscat, this has commendable dryness and acidity.",,86,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Envolve
US,"Almost all the oak is new or one year old, and the wine tastes and smells over-oaked, with clove, vanilla and caramel notes dominating. Underneath is a high-alcohol wine, whose cherry and blackberry flavors taste hot, sweet and jammy. Impresses for sheer volume, but is unbalanced, and not going anywhere.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,84,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Hanna
US,"Dry, tannic and tart, with an earthiness to the blackberries and cherries. Feels a bit rustic in the tannin structure. Ready now.",,85,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sojourn
US,"Heavy and soft, this is lacking in structure and vitality. It has some ripe flavors of blackberries, currants and spice. Drink up.",,85,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Envolve
US,"Rather heavy and full-bodied for a blush wine, with a dark color and considerable weight in the mouth. The raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors are tasty, but the wine lacks the airy lightness and elegance you want in a good rosé.",Caton Vineyard Syrah,84,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Ty Caton
US,"A disappointment from this esteemed vineyard, but consistent with Falcor's past record. The wine is thinly flavored and overly oaked, leaving an impression of woody, spicy citrus fruits.",Durell Vineyard,83,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Falcor
US,"A bit hot, with a chile pepper burn to the cherry, Porty-raisin flavors. Tastes like the grapes got sunburned.",Mountain Terraces Vineyard Reserve,84,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sojourn
US,"Too ripe, with pruny, raisiny flavors that are Porty and hot in high-alcohol, glyceriney heaviness. Defines a certain style, but not really balanced or food-friendly.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,82,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Brazin
US,"The dryness and earthiness of this wine are especially attractive. It shows tobacco, wild cherry, red currant, pepper and sandalwood flavors that are rich and complex. The alcohol is nearly 16%, but the wine wears it well.",HB Family Vineyard,87,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bump Wine Cellars
US,"Sweet in caramelized oak, this Chard also has jammy flavors of pears and apricots.",Estate,83,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nicholson Ranch
US,"A beautiful Syrah, richly textured and delicious. Held back for three years, it's perfect now for the soft texture, and the raspberry, cherry and orange zest flavors have a spicy edge. Complexity is enhanced with additions of Petite Sirah, Sangiovese, Barbera, Grenache and Viognier.",,90,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Kunde
US,"Gone are the big, hard tannins that used to mark Cabs from this vineyard. The '05 is soft and smooth, allowing the lush black and red cherry, currant, licorice, teriaki beef and smoky cedar flavors to shine. This wine should develop nicely over the next decade.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,92,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
US,"What's so likeable about this Cabernet is the dryness and the overall balance, which is stylish and elegant. It keeps the blackberry and black currant fruit in check with earthier tones of tobacco and olives.",Nuns Cliff Vineyard,90,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Watkins Family
US,"Great price for a Zin of this purity and varietal truth. Dry and medium-bodied, but sweet in fruit, it shows wonderful flavors of wild forest blackberries, with complications from black pepper, orange peel, anise and Asian spices. The texture is sheer velvet. Best now and through 2010.",,90,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cline
US,"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.",Jack London Vineyard,88,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Kenwood
US,"Young and fruity, offering an explosion of jammy cherries, blackberries and currants. Oak adds a framework of wood tannins that join grapeskin tannins to provide astringency and bite. Immature, and the question is ageability. Hold until 2013, but longterm prospects seem risky, given a certain raisiny superripeness.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,89,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
US,"Tastes a bit jammy sweet and direct now, with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Seems to need a year or three in the cellar to let everything soften and integrate. But it's not a 20-year wine.",Nuns Cliff,89,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Watkins Family
US,"Held back for four years before release, this Zin has achieved a creamy softness. The flavors offer a blast of peppery, briary wild red, black and blue berries and currants, with vibrant hints of bacon, cola and sandalwood. Great value in a Zinfandel this likeable.",,88,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Here's a solid, restaurant-style Cabernet that's dry and balanced enough to co-star with your food, rather than dominate it. It's a subdued wine, but quite elegant, with complex flavors of black cherries, currants, licorice and cedar wood. Drink now.",,88,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"There's an exotic touch of smoky bacon to this Cab, which may put some people off, but it lends complexity to the black currant and new oak flavors. The wine has a soft immediacy that renders it ready to drink now.",Marco DiGiulio,87,100,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lookout Ridge
US,"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes. The wine shows subtle oak notes, but is mainly notable for its forward flavors, elegant dryness and crisply bright acidity.",,88,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Kunde
US,"A good, rich, oaky Chardonnay that will satisfy your sweet tooth. It's bursting in ripe pineapple jam, lime, pear and buttered toast flavors, with clean, zesty acidity for balance.",,87,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Wellington
US,"Light salmon in color, this herbal rosé dances on the palate with a slight effervescence and 5% residual sugar. It offers a bouquet of robust red fruit and rose petal aromas, and saw no oak.",Rosé of,88,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Ty Caton
US,"New oak seems to dominate this Chard, swamping the actual flavor of the wine. The grapes provide lovely apricots and pineapples, balanced with fine acidity, but the oak swamps with smoke and vanilla and sappy wood cream.",Damaris Reserve,84,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Landmark
US,"Simple and sweet. This Sauvignon has sugary flavors of pineapples, limes, peaches and apples, and benefits from crisp acidity.",,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wellington
US,"Simple and superoaky, with strong flavors of vanilla and char dominating an otherwise average Chard. Under all that smoky wood you'll find a wine of modest peach, pineapple and apricot flavors.",,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Wellington
US,"Jammy and direct, this Marsanne has flavors of peaches, limes, honeysuckle and vanilla. It's a simple wine whose acidity will check Asian food or something tasty and sweet, like ham.",Estate,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,Wellington
US,"This is a sound Cabernet Sauvignon. It's very dry and quite tannic, with pure blackberry, black currant and blueberry flavors, and it finishes with a soft gentleness. At its best now, and the price is good for the quality.",,87,17,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kunde
US,"This bottling by fine producer Kunde always shows a grassy, hay-like note to the citrus fruit flavors, so if that's your style, you'll like it. The wine itself is only lightly oaked, and feels crisp and clean in the mouth, as well as dry. The low alcohol is a pleasure.",Magnolia Lane,87,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
US,"A nice, slightly sweet white wine, with tropical fruit, buttered toast, white flower and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail sipper.",Estate Vineyard,86,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,Wellington
US,"Good for drinking now, it's bright in acidity, with long-lasting flavors of Meyer lemon, cantaloupe, vanilla bean and honey.",,87,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Lake Sonoma
US,"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,83,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"A decent everyday Cab that's upfront in blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with smoky, spicy wood notes. It finishes dry and tannic and a little rustic.",,84,34,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peter Cellars
US,"A mere 174 cases of this wine were produced. It shares the essence of the '03 Monte Rosso Zin, reviewed below, but is richer and more concentrated, as well as much higher in alcohol, pushing 16%. Thoroughly dry, with flavors of coffee, dried blackberries, bitter chocolate and cloves, this is a complex, impressive wine.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Toreador,92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"From an old-field blended vineyard with all sorts of varieties, the wine has a real sense of style and place. It's not modernly elegant, but it is a true representative of old-time Sonoma red wine. It's like drinking history.",Casa Santinamaria Vineyards,86,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Saxon Brown
US,"This high-altitude vineyard, way above Sonoma Valley, is often the source of tannic, ageworthy reds. In this warm vintage, the grapes grew very ripe, almost raisined, and the wine is soft. It's not going to age. But it's tasty now in black currant and chocolate flavors, and will be nice with barbecue.",Grand Reserve Monte Rosso Vineyard,86,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Villa Mt. Eden
US,"A flavorful, full-bodied white with the body of a leesy Chardonnay, but different flavors. Citrus fruits, almond skin, apricots and an almost Musqué-type floweriness lead to a long, citrusy, crisp finish.",Casa Santinamaria Vineyards,86,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sémillon,Saxon Brown
US,"Massive, complex, with amazing depth, an opulent, voluptuous wine of tremendous power and authority. It's so beautiful now, you almost hesitate to cellar it, but these Hanzell Chards are built for the long haul. Positively volcanic in tropical fruit and toasty new oak, with a honeyed, caramel finish. Absolutely stunning.",,96,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"This is the second vintage Sbragia has accessed this vineyard. The result is a spectacular 100% Cabernet, stunning now but cellar-worthy. It's a big wine, decadent in cassis and milk chocolate fruit that's massively oaked and ample in tannins, but somehow it all pulls together to make for balance and harmony. Should hold and improve through 2015, at least.",Monte Rosso,94,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"This isn't one of your tropical fruit and oak, acidic cool-climate monster Chards. It's soft and earthy, with a dried sage and oregano edge to the green apple and white peach flavors.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,86,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"If you're looking for a Cabernet that has all the hallmarks of California cool-climate ripeness and balance, without demanding to be noticed for itself, try this one. It's dry, elegant and juicy, teasing the palate with fruit, yet wisely pulls back at the last moment, so the food can star. The black currants and smoky oak will perfectly match a charred steak.",Heritage Reserve,92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"Deep briary, wild-berry and pepper aromas. In the mouth, it's ripe and sweetly fruity, with soft tannins and pepper-spice notes. It's bone dry, with adequate acidity. Classic Sonoma Zin in its expressive exuberance and unpolished likeability.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,88,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"You'll find luscious flavors of sour red cherries, anise, pecan pie, cola and smoke in this dry wine. But it's a little too soft, structurally, which will limit development. Drink now.",Artist Series Cactus Hill,87,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Nicholson Ranch
US,"Always a good bet, this single-vineyard wine bursts from the glass with grass and hay aromas, citrus fruits, vanilla and creamy, smoky notes. It's superrich in the mouth, with tons of ripe peach and tangerine flavors and a hint of honeyed sweetness, but it's basically dry. A fine partner for toasted sourdough rounds topped with goat cheese and olive tapenade. Editors' Choice.",Magnolia Lane,87,13,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
US,"Very ripe and jammy, with upfront flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, persimmons, cinnamon and smoky cedar. Appeals instantly for its candied nature. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,86,47,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sand Hill
US,"Ledson held this wine back for almost 4 years, but it's still pretty tannic. Shows an astringency that makes your gums numb. But there are pleasant blackberry and cherry flavors, and the wine could soften in a few years before the fruit fades.",,86,44,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Ledson
US,"Gallo's Rancho Zabaco has done a fine job with single-vineyard Zins. This one is an excellent  wine, dry, balanced and with the structure of Merlot, with firm tannins encasing berry, earth, coffee and anise flavors.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.",Durell Vineyard,85,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sand Hill
US,"This is a straightforward wine with a certain resemblance to Sauvignon Blanc for its dry crispness and grassy, citrus flavors. But there's a richer streak of apricots, wildflowers and tangerines and a Chardonnay-like creaminess, that lends complexity and appeal.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,Wellington
US,"Dark, robust, dry, full bodied, tannic and acidic. That pretty much sums up this old-fashioned, young wine. It's a serious cellar candidate, stuffed with blackberry jam, leather and coffee flavors. Best after 2010 and for years beyond.",Artist Collection,88,31,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Imagery
US,"Very sweet but clumsy, with a weird medicinal, Band-Aid smell. The sugary blackberry taste is one-dimensional.",Serres Ranch Late Harvest,80,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Aleatico,Generations of Sonoma
US,"Slightly sweet in spearmint gum and lemonade flavors, this wine has decent acidity. It leaves the mouth clean and refreshed.",,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wellington
US,"This seductive, creamy Chard wraps smoky, spicy, vanilla-laden oak flavors around a core of lush tropical fruit. There's lively acidity and a lot to like here. The finish shows a slight edge that may smooth out in another three or four months.",Great Estates,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
US,"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the—oh…I mean…coladas and ripe banana, caramel and pear aromas and flavors, then this wine delivers. There's an undeniable coconut quality here, and nice acid zip that keeps the fruit in the mix. The oak tannins need a bit of time to smooth out—they're a little edgy on the back end.",Parmelee-Hill Vineyard,89,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Steele
US,"A bit hot in alcohol, but rich and peppery, with flavors of roasted blackberries, cherry liqueur, chocolate and anise. Good with barbecue.",,84,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cline
US,"A nice, rich Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with lots of different kinds of foods. With some new oak, it has fruity-sweet flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots and lemongrass, with a tang of gooseberry.",Estate,86,23,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Beltane Ranch
US,"For decades Hanzell has been making one of California's most (and only) ageworthy Chards. The '03 is one for the cellar, but it comes at the price of being hard in youth. Starts out flinty and tannic, although as it airs, new oak and pineapple emerge. This seems like a very good Hanzell. Best 2009–2015.",,92,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"Soft and direct, with black cherry jam and oak flavors. Drink now.",Estate,84,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Wellington

US,"Lots of polished, ripe blackberry, cherry, mocha and spicy flavors in this dry, rather tannic wine. It shows good structure and balance. Best now.",Caton Vineyard,86,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Ty Caton
US,"Raw in the mouth, with green, stemmy tannins and a chlorophyll taste to the berry-cherry flavors. So it's not quite ripe. But it's dry and okay with barbecue.",,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"A very fruity, extracted Zin, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors that finish with a bite of acidity. Clean and easy to drink, it's a nice sipper with summer barbecue.",Bedrock,85,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Enkidu
US,"Comes down on the soft, earthy side, with an herb and tobacco edge to the cherry-berry fruit. There's some heat in the finish, but overall, the wine wears its high alcohol tolerably well.",Caton Vineyard,83,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Ty Caton
US,"Tough and earthy, with gritty tannins framing tobacco, black cherry and oak flavors. A good everyday Cab from this warmish appellation.",,84,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jacella
US,"Starts off with herbaceous aromas, including mint, but plenty of swirling releases riper ones of black cherries and cocoa. There's a pretty texture, with soft but firm tannins and soft acidity. It's not especially fruity, but it's sleek and elegant, and rich foods will certainly wake up some of its sleeping sweetness.",Block Collection - Shorenstein Vineyard,85,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Geyser Peak
US,"The texture's all wrong on this wine, because the ripeness levels and tannins are unbalanced. The cherry and wood flavors have streaks of green and jalapeño pepper, and there's some funkiness.",Mountain Cuvée,82,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Spotted Owl
US,"Ripe and full-bodied with tiers of fruit flavors ranging from green apples and peaches to pears and mango. None-too-subtle oak adds vanilla, smoke and butterscotch elements. Just enough residual sugar for it to drink a bit like an orange-vanilla milk shake.",,88,16,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"Rhône white blends are among the toughest to pull off in California, but Atmosphere does a terrific job. Among the top of its class, it's bone dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle, complex flavors of white peach, papaya, fig, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Really good. Try as an alternative to a rich Chardonnay.",La Prenda Vineyard Dos Burros,93,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Atmosphere
US,"A first-rate Sauvignon Blanc. Bone dry and crisp and clean in mouthwatering acidity, it has wonderfully complex gooseberry, lime, grapefruit and kiwi flavors. Among the top of its class, and a great value.",Demark St. Vineyard Tribute,92,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Atmosphere
US,"Nice and lush. The flavors of cherry, cassis, anise, milk chocolate and cinnamon spice are just delicious, and there's a good texture, too. Ripe, firm tannins girdle the wine, and just-enough acidity keeps it from tasting candied. Drink now for its youthful babyfat.",V,88,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
US,"Kudos to the winery for picking at low brix and for keeping the residual sugar so low so that the wine is absolutely dry. It lets the palate really appreciate the acid-brightened flavors of exotic fruits, wildflowers, and, especially, Asian spices. The wine could be more concentrated, but it's still a good sipper.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,88,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"Open tonight and enjoy for its immediate pleasures. Soft and expressive, it shows a wealth of cherry, blackberry, raspberry, cola, licorice, cedar and vanilla-spice flavors that are wrapped into rich, finely ground tannins. Nice with a grilled steak.",Gregory Vineyard,88,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
US,"Made like an old-fashioned Barbera, this one is truculent in tannins, with a full-bodied mouthfeel housing flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, anise and pepper. It will probably live for two decades, gradually sweetening as it throws sediment, but always remaining rustic.",Augusto,87,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Viansa
US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies.",Los Chamizal,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hopper Creek
US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level. The pepper- and mineral-infused flavors suggest peaches and grapefruits, enriched with new oak and lees. This is an extremely dry, food-friendly wine.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,87,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"This wine typically starts life out as a young, tannic puppy, and although it has ripe flavors and a suppleness that can handle rich meats and cheeses, it's best to cellar it. This vintage is quite undeveloped, wrapped in tannic astringency, but with a hopeful core of fruit that should age well from 2008 on.",Oliver Hill Estate Vineyards,90,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"This bottling from Kunde is dependable for its dry, crisp elegance. It always shows bright lemongrass and gooseberry fruit, with more exotic notes of litchi and fig. The trick is to control disagreeable greenness, which pops up here in the finish.",Magnolia Lane,86,16,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
US,"A sleekly dry, minerally Chardonnay that shows a fine, steely structure, yet doesn't stint on fruit. The pineapple, pear and flowery honeysuckle flavors are accented with richer touches of buttered toast from oak barrels.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Deerfield Ranch
US,"Rich and fruity, a voluptuous Cab with flavors of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, with notes of raisins and a nice appliqué of toasty cedar. Good over the next few years.",Maycacamas Mountains,87,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Angels

US,"Rich and spicy, this Zin has waves of cherry jam, raspberry purée, mocha, cinnamon-pepper spice and vanilla oak flavors. It's so fruity, it's almost sweet, an impression heightened by softness.",,84,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Tough, dry and tannic, with an unrelieved quality, this is a wine that needs serious time in the cellar or major decanting to let it soften. There's a heart of blackberry and pomegranate fruit that should withstand these tests. Even 12 hours of decanting would not be too much.",Syrcab,87,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,B.R. Cohn
US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package. But the wine would benefit from more acidity and less sweetness.",Garbiella Ranch,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,VJB
US,"and sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and carob flavors. Tasty enough, but seriously lacks the acidity to make this fruity wine come alive. From Cartlidge & Browne.",,83,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moser Scharding

US,"Awkward. Despite some cherry jam and candied licorice flavors, accented by quite a bit of oak, there's a semi-sweet sharpness in the finish reminiscent of cough medicine, and a touch of sweaty funk.",Sonoma Mountain-Top Vineyards,83,54,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bush-Field
US,"Grown in the famous Monte Rosso Vineyard, this rosé has the complex interest of a red wine, but it's a blush and is properly light-bodied and silky. It's dry and crisp, and shows bitter cherryskin, white tobacco and spice flavors.",Rosato di Sangiovese Monte Rosso Vineyards,87,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Muscardini

US,"A blend of Bordeaux and Rhône varieties, this is a dry, somewhat rugged wine, whose best feature is fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, even cranberries and cocoa show up in the complex flavors. There's a tannic, acidic streak that makes it a little tough, though.",Tytanium,86,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ty Caton
US,"Extracted, tannic, dark and dense, with briary, jammy fruit and thick tannins. Blackberries and chocolate, set off with lots of acid. It's a sensational, balanced, bold, ageworthy Zin.",Pagani Reserve,91,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis

US,"Ripe, strawberry/raspberry preserves, with a pleasing, jammy, fruity, luscious richness. Ten percent Petite Sirah adds color and punch. There's a fair amount of tannin, but overall a nice balance, and the plush fruit is the highlight.",,89,19,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Castle
US,"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourvèdre in it. Interesting and flavorful, though not entirely varietal in character. The mix of spices tastes a bit like a Provençal wine, and it's delicious for the price.",,89,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Fully mature now, although it still has a good six years left, this shows why certain Zins benefit from aging. Tight and tannicly dry to begin with, it has aged to something approaching Pinot-like delicacy, although the wild berry, roasted coffee and spice flavors are Zinny, and few Zinfandels will ever have these tannins.",Stellwagen Vineyard,92,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards

US,"This solid, mainstream Zinfandel displays blackberry fruit and some creamy notes on the nose. Well-defined, dark berry flavors with white pepper and leather accents mark the palate. The mouthfeel is even and the finish here is brisk, tart and juicy. A touch less oak might let the fruit shine a bit more.",Jack London Vineyard,86,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"Easy to imagine drinking this with a really nice lamb dish or grilled steak. It has an upscale feeling, with a complex interplay of tannins and oak, and the flavors are long, lush and liqueur-like. However, it's soft, and not ageable.",,90,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Sharpness compromises this wine. Whether the acidity is natural or added, it's intrusive, cutting the palate and giving a sour candy taste to the blackberries, currants and cherries. Ready now.",Gracie Creek Vineyards,85,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Muscardini
US,"Dark, oaky, and fine in every respect. Sonoma Valley, often underrated as Merlot country, lends the fruit a very deep and satisfying blackberry component, which is highlighted, in this case, by toasty oak. The tannins are soft and finely etched. Gorgeous stuff, quite lovely now, but the solid core of fruit indicates mid-term aging potential.",Massara Vineyard,92,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"This mountain wine is thick in dusty tannins, and too young to fully enjoy now. But it's a guaranteed ager, with its balance of acids and deep, delicious core of black currant, black cherry, cola and cocoa flavors. It has that extra edge of complexity that makes for a great Cabernet. Drink after 2007.",Reserve,92,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"The workhorse wine from this Pinot master is pretty darned good, especially considering the price. Lovely, deep aromas of black cherry, tobacco, coffee and nutmeg, with a waft of vanilla-tinged oak introduce a wine that is ripe and sweet in the mouth. The vintage was a good one, and the fruit is really succulent. It's not a keeper, however, and it won't improve in the cellar, but it's so good there's no reason not to drink it all up now.",,90,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
US,"Full-bodied, thick in the mouth, soft and a little clumsy, this Syrah is marked by cherry, berry, chocolate and oak flavors. It's not going to get any better with age.",Estate,84,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Deerfield Ranch
US,"A clean, well made wine displaying Cab Franc's herbaceous, earthy, and spicy-floral side.  Drinks on the lean side, with some spare, delicate berry fruit; it definitely needs food to bring out its best qualities.  Very dry.",,84,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Nelson
US,"You're struck by the darkness of this wine. Also it's aroma, which is deep and brooding, like something from a vault. In the mouth, the wine is dry and tannic, intended for the cellar. And with its vast core of black cherry and pomegranate fruit and clean balance, it seems destined to ride out the years. Best after 2009 and beyond.",St. Jean Estate Vineyard,90,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Malbec,Chateau St. Jean

US,"Way too sweet for a table wine. Hard to tell if it's the 16% alcohol or residual sugar, maybe both. Too soft.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,81,51,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna
US,"A very good Cabernet, rich and dry, but you'll want to decant it for a few hours to let it soften. Right out of the bottle it's rough, giving a gritty feeling to the ripe blackberries and currants. Drink now–2012.",,88,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clarbec
US,"Lovely, delicately silky, light-bodied and elegant, with charm and finesse. Some may find it lean in fruit, which emphasizes the acidity, but it's a connoisseur's Pinot Noir that gets better as it breathes. You have to understand complexity and subtlety in this variety to appreciate this bone-dry, cherry skin-tart wine. Best now through 2010.",Chris Lee Vineyard,92,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"A controversial wine. On the plus side are dryness and silky elegance, courtesy of finely ground tannins and crisp acidity, while the cherry and earthy tobacco and truffle flavors are restrained and complex. But then there's the price, which seems excessive. You decide.",Poggio Alla Pietra Brunello di Sonoma,87,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Petroni
US,"Pretty much a copy of the '03, which I found too ripe and Porty. Although the wine is dry, it has raisiny flavors, with a stewed fruit, prune and chocolate pie crust quality. Actually tastes hotter than the official alcohol reading of 14.5%.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Gnarly Vine,84,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Louis M. Martini
US,"A very fine rosé, this is bone dry, low in alcohol, and very crisp and clean in acidity. That's the perfect trifecta for a blush wine. Flavorwise, it's all about strawberries, peaches and Provençal herbs.",Alice's Vineyards Rosato di Sangiovese,91,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Muscardini
US,"This is appealing for its richness, but it's heavily oaked with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors that overwhelm the underlying fruit. Too bad, because it's a nice Chardonnay with bright pineapple and orange flavors supported by fine acidity.",Wildwood Vineyard,86,27,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde

US,"Zinfandel combines the variety's classic flavors of spices, briary wild summer blackberries and raspberries, cola and licorice with Merlot-like silky balance and elegance. While there's a wonderful sweetness, the finish is dry. An absolute steal, and relatively easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",Sustainably Farmed and Estate Grown,91,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"The grapes for this wine are said to be 128 years old. The vine yield was very low, barely two tons per acre, which accounts for the impressive concentration of flavor. The black and red currants, raspberries, licorice and mint chocolate are augmented by smoky oak, which adds rich notes of vanilla and toast. The alcohol is a little high, but that's Zin for you.",Reserve Century Vines,91,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"A rich, dry young Cabernet, with fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity. The tannins are strong, however, giving the wine a sandpapery astringency.

US,"A lush, soft Cab Franc, if a little one-dimensional. Shows pleasant cherry, herb and cedar flavors, wrapped into firm tannins, and the finish is totally dry. Drink now.",MacAllister Vineyard,87,46,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Eponymous
US,"True to the Schug style, this is dry, earthy and less flamboyant than many of today's Cabs. But it's also elegant, and its modesty wants to support food, not overwhelm it. With its finely delineated black currants, anise, dried herbs and oak, it's a lovely wine to drink now, and should gain traction over the next 5–6 years.",Heritage Reserve,91,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug

Appeals immediately to the senses. This is easily Wellington's best Chardonnay in a decade.",,89,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Wellington
US,"This wine is seemingly sweet and soft, with very ripe black cherry and persimmon flavors. In fact, it's almost too ripe, with a hint of raisins on the finish. Drink now.",OMG Three Barrels,84,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Spann Vineyards

US,"For whatever the reason, this winery's Bordeaux reds, including Merlot, have shown tremendous improvement over the last few years.

It's a fine wine to drink with grilled steak.",Cherryblock,94,90,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"A bit rustic and rowdy, in the way of Malbec, with big, edgy tannins and a scour of acidity.

Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar, and it will develop interestingly beyond that.",,93,70,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"Hews to the Hanzell style, which is almost old-fashioned in this age of ripely opulent Pinot Noirs. This one's tight as a drum in tannins and acids, a quivery, nervously wound wine. Yet it's quite rich and complex, with a tapestry of cherry, red licorice, tobacco, Canadian bacon, dusty Indian spice and buttered toast flavors.  Needs 7–8 years in the cellar, and, based on tastings of very old Hanzell, should slowly unfold through the 2020s.",Ambassador's 1953 Vineyard,93,145,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"Dryness and tannins mark this Cabernet, giving it some austerity and astringency. But lurking deep below the surface is a vast underground landscape of blackberry fruit, cassis, plums, olives, herbs and oak. Fascinating and intricate and a little heady, but undrinkable now due to immaturity. Needs 5–6 years to show its stuff.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,92,70,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"Sweet and sour, like a Chinese pineapple sauce, and there's an ammonia taste that detracts. On the plus side there's mouthwatering acidity and a clean finish.",,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Highway 12
US,"Too soft for comfort. Lacks structural integrity and lively acidity to balance out the rich blackberry, currant, anise and cocoa flavors, and there's peppery heat from high alcohol. Drink now.",Caton Vineyard,84,44,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Ty Caton
US,"High alcohol makes this wine seem hot. It's also very dry, and rich, oily foods will coax out its sweet berry essence.",Rowe Vineyard,84,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis
US,"This tastes barely ripe, with a vegetal flavor compromsing the chocolate and cherry notes. It's soft, making it fall a little flat in the mouth.",Gracie Creek Vineyards,80,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Muscardini
US,"Soft, fruity and spicy, this Zinfandel is starting to pick up some bottle-age notes. The currant and black raspberry flavors are joined by sautéed mushroom and charred bone accents. The rich tannins suggest pairing it with roasted or barbecued meats.",Meeks Hilltop Ranch,90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"Hanzell says this Sebella Chardonnay is meant to drink now, while their regular Chardonnay, which is famously ageable, develops in the cellar. That's strange logic, because the wine is so close to the regular Chardonnay as to be nearly indistinguishable. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally, with citrus, green apple and pear flavors. Give it 3–5 years.",Sebella,92,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"Dark as a moonless midnight, dry as dust, with hard-edged tannins, this Cabernet is almost undrinkable now in its extreme youth. It shows a massive core of blackberries, currants, dark baker's chocolate and smoky oak, and the balance of acidity makes it clean and bright. All indications are of a cellarworthy wine. Drink 2014 and beyond.",Reserve Speciale,92,110,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"Lots of fresh, zingy acidity in this dry, young Chardonnay, and the steely minerality gives it a tang of cold metal. There are tantalizing hints of ripe citrus fruit and apricots. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.",,92,70,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"Shut down by hard tannins and utterly dry, this fine young Cabernet is simply not ready to drink. It's very rich in blackberries, smoked meat and charred wood, with a finish that's fine, long and sweet in ripe fruits. Should blossom after 2014 and hold for a number of years.",,92,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood

US,"There's something lusty about this wine. It's the strong berry, cherry and chocolate flavors, combined with powerful tannins and an immediately delicious umami taste. Seems best now.",MacAllister Vineyard,89,46,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Eponymous
US,"Shows the dry tannins and astringency of youthful Hanzell, but these Pinot Noirs are famously capable of extended aging. Tastes almost rustic now, with a deep core of cherries and cola. The oak is unintegrated, further accentuating the wine's immaturity. Needs time. Better after 2013, and should develop for an additional decade.",,91,95,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"A polished, complex wine to drink now, despite considerable tannins. Give it a decant for a few hours to let it mellow. Shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice, cola and smoky oak flavors that are young, intense and nervy in acids.",Reserve,91,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Highway 12
US,"Berries are the name of the game in this rich, forward Syrah. Cherries, raspberries, mulberries and spicier, gamier kinds of wild berries mark the flavors, which are lifted by sweet, smoky oak. The mouthfeel is pure and velvety, courtesy of ripely soft tannins. A fashionable wine to drink now, especially with lamb.",,91,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Exuberance
US,"Hanzell Pinots age for a long time and are not particularly appealing in youth. This is dry and rustic, with flavors of cola, baked cherry pie and spice set into hefty tannins. It's made in a contrarian style to today's tastes. This is one to stash in the cellar. Drink 20152019, or even longer, if you like really old Pinots.",,92,95,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"A great, elegant Cabernet to drink now and for the next four years or so.

Gets better as it breathes in the glass.",Réserve Spéciale,93,110,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood

US,"Rhône white blends are among the toughest to pull off in California, but Atmosphere does a terrific job. Among the top of its class, it's bone dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle, complex flavors of white peach, papaya, fig, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Really good.

US,"A little soft, but delicious and complex. It has waves of raspberry, cherry, sweet cola, red licorice and oaky cedar flavors, with a spicy edge of smoked meat, like cured salumi. Feels elegant, although it lacks the structure for aging, so drink now.",,89,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Exuberance
US,"This Pinot, which was grown on the Hanzell estate, is described by the winery as a barrel selection made to drink now. Yet it shows tight tannins and an astringency that effectively masks the ripe cherry and pomegranate fruit flavors. You're better off cellaring this wine for a few years.",Sebella,89,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"A rich, chocolaty Cabernet, sweet in glycerine, blackberry jam and toast flavors, brushed with spices. Good tannins and acids, but it's a bit on the sweet side.",Montecillo Vineyard,87,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Keating
US,"The sweetness got out of hand in this wine, which tastes like it has excessive residual sugar. There's a raspberry and white chocolate power bar flavor. That's delicious, of course, but consumers should know the wine isn't dry.",Stellwagen Vineyard,87,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Cabernets from this famous vineyard have varied in quality over the years, across multiple brands, but this new release is a winner, continuing Brion's streak of success. It's soft, luscious and instantly drinkable now for its gentle tannins. The flavors are of milk chocolate, blackberry essence, black currant and smoky cedar.",Monte Rosso,92,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Brion

US,"While this Zin is high in alcohol, which gives it some peppery heat, it's dry and complex. The flavors range from ripe blackberry, blueberry and currant to dark chocolate, licorice and warm-climate Zin spice. The vineyard contains 80-year-old vines, grown in the mountains above the valley floor, which explains the wine's unique concentration.",Fredericks Vineyard,91,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Turley
US,"A beautiful Syrah, richly textured and delicious. Held back for three years, it's perfect now for the soft texture, and the raspberry, cherry and orange zest flavors have a spicy edge. Complexity is enhanced with additions of Petite Sirah, Sangiovese, Barbera, Grenache and Viognier.",,90,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Kunde

US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies.",Los Chamizal,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hopper Creek

US,"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah had no problem achieving ripeness. It explodes in blackberry, cherry, chocolate, licorice, teriaki beef, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that go on and on. The structure is a little too soft and weak to support all this weight, though. Drink now.",Tesoro,87,47,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Muscardini

US,"Give this Bordeaux blend a good, long decant before you pour. It's tight and young in tannins and acids, and the blackberry, cherry and currant flavors have a jammy edge.

US,"Fruity and easy to drink, but not a good representation of this famous mountain vineyard, at this price. The wine is sweet and simple in candied raspberries, blackberries, licorice and milk chocolate. Maybe it was released too early. Try cellaring for a couple years.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,86,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Muscardini
US,"Very tannic and gritty now. Shuts the fruit down with a dry, sandpapery astringency. But what great fruit. It's rich in blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and mocha, and is bone dry. Could and should age, but there's a certain sharpness that makes you wonder.",Anthem,88,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,St. Francis

US,"Young and fruity, offering an explosion of jammy cherries, blackberries and currants. Oak adds a framework of wood tannins that join grapeskin tannins to provide astringency and bite. Immature, and the question is ageability.

But it's not a 20-year wine.",Nuns Cliff,89,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Watkins Family
US,"Held back for four years before release, this Zin has achieved a creamy softness. The flavors offer a blast of peppery, briary wild red, black and blue berries and currants, with vibrant hints of bacon, cola and sandalwood. Great value in a Zinfandel this likeable.",,88,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde

US,"You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin.

Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.",Old Hill Single Vineyard,95,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"Fans of sheer fruit will exult in this wine for its masses of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, chocolate and even raspberries that flood the palate. Beyond that, it offers good tannins and fine acidity. There isn't much complexity or layering, but it sure is tasty.",Summit,87,52,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Audelssa
US,"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes.

US,"This bottling by fine producer Kunde always shows a grassy, hay-like note to the citrus fruit flavors, so if that's your style, you'll like it. The wine itself is only lightly oaked, and feels crisp and clean in the mouth, as well as dry. The low alcohol is a pleasure.",Magnolia Lane,87,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
US,"A minor wine, dry, tannic and awkward, with modest cherry, cola and oak flavors. Okay for everyday drinking, but not going anywhere.",Jack London Vineyard,84,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"Delicious and classy, this is based on Merlot, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties in proper proportion. It flatters immediately with its wealth of blackberries, black cherries, cola and mocha that finish so dry and spicy, yet it has that extra complexity that makes it intellectually interesting.

US,"This is a strongly flavored young wine. There's nothing subtle about the blast of blackberries, cherries and currants, of the sweet, smoky oak.

It's an intense wine that doesn't seem likely to make gains with age, so drink up after an hour or two in the decanter.",Reserve,87,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kunde
US,"Sweet in caramelized oak, this Chard also has jammy flavors of pears and apricots.",Estate,83,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Nicholson Ranch
US,"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,95,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"A very good Cabernet, rich and dry, but you'll want to decant it for a few hours to let it soften. Right out of the bottle it's rough, giving a gritty feeling to the ripe blackberries and currants. Drink now–2012.",,88,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clarbec
US,"Gone are the big, hard tannins that used to mark Cabs from this vineyard. The '05 is soft and smooth, allowing the lush black and red cherry, currant, licorice, teriaki beef and smoky cedar flavors to shine. This wine should develop nicely over the next decade.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,92,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
US,"This is a Zin for lovers of big, ripe to overripe, tannic, high-alcohol interpretations of the variety. Made from very old vines, the flavors are mainly of raisins, with complexities of oak, balsam and peppery spices.",Reserve Pagani Vineyard,86,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis
US,"Pretty run of the mill, a tannic Cab with flavors of herbs and berries. Fulfills the basic requirements of dryness and full-bodied balance. Drink now.",Silver Label,84,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"Great price for a Zin of this purity and varietal truth. Dry and medium-bodied, but sweet in fruit, it shows wonderful flavors of wild forest blackberries, with complications from black pepper, orange peel, anise and Asian spices. The texture is sheer velvet. Best now and through 2010.",,90,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cline
US,"Napa Cabernet specialist Krutz has been assembling a good record for Chardonnay in recent years, and with this release, Krutz reaches into Sonoma Valley, with excellent results.

It's a Champagne-like Chardonnay, defined by elegance.",Ceja Vineyard Magnolia Series,91,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Krutz
US,"Made from Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache, this is a fairly ordinary red wine, with cherry, currant, smoke, spice and herb flavors. Drink now.",Côte de Lune Rouge,84,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style Red Blend,Arrowood
US,"Seemingly sweet and oaky, this has buttered popcorn, buttered toast and caramel cream flavors. The fruit suggests pineapples and pears.",Kinneybrook Vineyard,85,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"Overripe, juicy and soft, this has baked fruit flavors, like blackberries and cherries in a pie. Oak adds to the sweetness with sugary caramel. It's rich, but it lacks complexity and ageworthiness.",Rancho Salina,85,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Muscardini
US,"Made in a New Zealand style, which is very dry, crisp in acidity, minerally and rich in citrus flavors, with a sour, green note of gooseberry. A brisk Sauvignon Blanc that will love goat cheese.",,87,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wellington
US,"This very dry Cabernet feels rugged and gritty in the mouth, with too much acidity that lends bite. The austerity is relieved by black cherry and sweet tobacco flavors. Drink up.",Madrone Ridge Vineyard,85,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Muscardini
US,"Frankly sweet, as are so many Steele wines, this Syrah tastes like alcoholized cherry and blackberry jelly, with a chocolate fudge and caramelized finish.",Parmalee-Hill Vineyard,81,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Steele
US,"Ripe and balanced, a nice, clean Merlot to drink now with savory sausages. It's dry and tannic, with flavors of black cherries, black currants, cola and sandalwood, and a dusty, mouthwatering coating of Asian spices.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Wellington
US,"Tons of fruit in this Cabernet, with oodles of blackberries and cherries, and the label is pretty. Missing a certain subtle complexity, but enough elegance remains to impress.",La Bohéme Artist Series,87,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"For the past several years, this Zin has suffered from the same flaw, excessive alcohol. Some wines get away with it. This one, with its raisiny, baked fruit taste, harsh tannins and hot mouthfeel, does not.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Gnarly Vine,83,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Louis M. Martini
US,"There's a rustic quality to the tannins, which are chewy and stemmy and not quite ripe. They give a tough mouthfeel to the black cherry, black currant and caramelized oak flavors. Decant before serving.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Petite Verdot,Wellington
US,"Despite the “valley” appellation, this is one of the highest elevation vineyards in Sonoma County. It's a dense, tannic, concentrated wine, with a deep core of black currants, black pepper and chocolate. Zinfanatics will absolutely love it, but it's very high in alcohol, almost Port-like, although the finish is absolutely dry.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,88,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna
US,"Made from indeterminate varieties, this is a tannic, jammy wine whose blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate taste like they were baked into a pie. It's dry and tannic, without any particular subtlety. Drink now.",,86,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Trios
US,"The wine brims with pineapples, Asian pears and papayas, dusted with every spice in your pantry. It's bone dry, with a crisp bite of acidity. A touch of oak and lees gives it a rich edge of cream and buttered toast.",,88,17,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"There's bracing heat in this Zin that's blended with 20% Petite Sirah. The heat comes partly from the high alcohol, partly from the notes of crushed white and black peppercorns, partly from the charred new oak and partly from the baked quality that marks the blackberry note. Everything about this lusty, delicious wine begs for grilled and roasted meats and poultry—especially game birds.",Barricia,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"A big improvement over the 2007, but still a rather simply constructed wine. It has pleasant berry, cherry, cola and spice flavors, and is easy to drink.",Mountain Cuvee,86,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Spotted Owl
US,"A very nice Cabernet that's superdrinkable because of its soft, appealing fruit, but also has plenty of complexity. Cherries, blackberries, blueberries and dark chocolate are enriched with spicy oak notes, leading to a long, balanced finish.",,89,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"A rich, ripe Cabernet, forward in blackberry and cherry jam flavors. A hint of dried herb grounds it and provides a level of complexity, as does a touch of smoky cedar from oak barrel aging. It's not an ager, but it is fancy and delicious now.",Heritage Reserve,89,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"There's lots of spicy, fruity richness in this softly tannic Cabernet. It's lush and forward in flavors of blackberry and cherry pie, currant, plum and cola. In the winter, give it a brief decant, but if the weather's warm, you can even chill it for 15 minutes in the fridge: It's that kind of wine.",Four Barrels Top of the World,89,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spann Vineyards
US,"The winery says this was the longest hangtime vintage in their history. The fruit is extraordinarily ripe in blackberries and cherries, with a rich coating of smoky oak, but retains a nice tannin-acid balance. Scads of Asian spices make the finish exotic. Drink now.",,88,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Nicholson Ranch
US,"The Toreador bottling represents the best Zin winemaker Eric Cinnamon can make from the vineyard. So far, it's been a complex, ageworthy wine, and the '05 continues that tradition. Despite high alcohol, the wine is balanced, with firm tannins framing flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, pomegranates, red currants, leather, dark chocolate, briary nettles and smoke. It will happily take a decade of bottle age.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Toreador,92,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"A little heavy and overly extracted. Shows lots of ripe blackberries and black cherries, but fruit isn't everything. It's a wine that needs more levels of complexity.",,85,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wellington
US,"This very expensive release is one of the rare examples of Chardonnay that absolutely requires bottle age. Dry and leesy now, with a mineral compactness, it shows a rich core of baked peach, spiced apple, butterscotch and smoky honey. As it warms in the glass, it develops great flavor and textural complexities. Should come into its own by 2009, and improve for many years after.",Ambassador's 1953 Vineyard,96,180,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"Good spicy flavors in this briary, brambly wine. Tastes like freshly picked wild berries in the forest, with notes of pine, anise and pepper. Could be sturdier in texture, though, as it's a bit soft and melted.",Meeks Hilltop Ranch,85,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"This is rich and spicy, with the briary, brambly tastes of ripe blackberry and blueberry. It's high in alcohol, which gives it a slight burn. Enjoy it with robust Italian pasta and pizza dishes.",Old Hill,88,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"Here's a Merlot that just wants to support the food it's paired with, not dominate it. It's dry and balanced, teasing with cherries, herbs and oak, then pulling back to let the tannins and acids take a bow. Should develop a little complexity by spring 2008, but it's fine now.",,87,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Schug

US,"Dramatic, powerful flavors of blackberries and cassis liqueur explode in this wine—the classic markers of great Cabernet Sauvignon. At the same time, it shows softly refined tannins that make it firm but drinkable now. With a long, spicy finish, it shows considerable complexity. Best now; it will gradually lose fruit for another 6–7 years.",Olive Hill Estate Vineyards Special Selection,94,100,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"The ripeness of this wine stands out. The cherry flavors even have a slightly raisined edge. The wine is also fairly tannic. Additional flavor nuances include tangerine zest, wild raspberry, red currants and white pepper. This is a great Hanzell. Give it until 2010, and it should develop interesting bottle complexities for many years.",,93,90,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"Brings to mind the old jug wines, with its tannic dryness and earthy berry flavors. Those were the kind of wines that happily washed down anything that called for a red. So is this, although it's a lot pricier.",,87,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Montepulciano,VJB
US,"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot.",Old Hill Ranch,87,34,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bucklin
US,"You'll find luscious flavors of sour red cherries, anise, pecan pie, cola and smoke in this dry wine. But it's a little too soft, structurally, which will limit development. Drink now.",Artist Series Cactus Hill,87,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Nicholson Ranch
US,"This is a fine Cabernet, with ripe berry, cherry and cola flavors, tinged with smoky oak. The tannins are firm but pliant, making it drinkable now, though it could develop bottle complexity over the years.",Cross Creek Vineyard,88,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spann Vineyards
US,"There's a ton of Cabernet flavor here. The California sunshine of this warm appellation ripened the grapes to cassis and black cherry perfection. The oak and tannin structure is polished and fine, but acidity is a little low, so it's not an ager. Drink now through 2009 for its sheer lusciousness.",Old Hill Ranch Vineyard,87,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bucklin
US,"Very ripe and jammy, with upfront flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, persimmons, cinnamon and smoky cedar. Appeals instantly for its candied nature. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,86,47,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sand Hill
US,"Ledson held this wine back for almost 4 years, but it's still pretty tannic. Shows an astringency that makes your gums numb. But there are pleasant blackberry and cherry flavors, and the wine could soften in a few years before the fruit fades.",,86,44,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Ledson
US,"Soft and earthy, with dried herb and blackberry flavors tinged with smoky oak, this is a gentle Cabernet for drinking now. It has enough fanciness to partner with a nice steak or an upscale beef taco.",,87,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"Almost all the oak is new or one year old, and the wine tastes and smells over-oaked, with clove, vanilla and caramel notes dominating. Underneath is a high-alcohol wine, whose cherry and blackberry flavors taste hot, sweet and jammy. Impresses for sheer volume, but is unbalanced, and not going anywhere.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,84,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Hanna
US,"Tastes thick, old and tired, losing cherry and raspberry fruit and leaving behind vegetal notes. Not going anywhere.",,83,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Canihan
US,"This full-bodied Zin feels young, with zingy acids framing jammy cherry, blackberry, mushu plum sauce and peppery spice flavors. It's an exuberant wine that's notable for its tannic richness. Will age well, and best now through 2010 with barbecued pork or short ribs.",Jack London Vineyard,90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"This has been the source of some good to excellent Zins for Kunde over the years. They say the vines are 125 years old. The wine is dense and layered, with dried briary fruit, sweet black currant, licorice, leather and Asian spice flavors that are wrapped into punchy, somewhat aggressive tannins. The alcohol is very high, but the wine doesn't taste hot or unbalanced.",Shaw Vineyard Reserve Century Vines,91,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Rather heavy and full-bodied for a blush wine, with a dark color and considerable weight in the mouth. The raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors are tasty, but the wine lacks the airy lightness and elegance you want in a good rosé.",Caton Vineyard Syrah,84,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Ty Caton
US,"Another new Rosenblum release and as usual, there is a sweet, sugary edge to the cherries, blackberries and chocolate, although very high acidity helps keep the mouthfeel lively. The official alcohol is 14.8%, but there is something ruby Porty going on.",Maggie's Reserve,86,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"Kunde has nailed this price point for Syrah. It's rich and complex enough to put on the table beside a fine meal, and while it's not quite in the league of a cult Syrah, on the other hand it won't demand all the attention. Dry and finely tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, leather, mocha, tobacco, pepper and sage, and finishes long and spicy.",,90,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Kunde
US,"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.",Durell Vineyard,85,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sand Hill

US,"A bit hot in alcohol, but rich and peppery, with flavors of roasted blackberries, cherry liqueur, chocolate and anise. Good with barbecue.",,84,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cline
US,"This is a dry, soft Syrah with some dusty tannins you'll have to negotiate, but a grilled steak, or almost anything with a BBQ char, should do well.

US,"This new 100% Cab from the esteemed winemaker, Richard Arrowood, is made in the modern, cult style, which is to say it has high alcohol, soft acids and gentle tannins, and has lush, almost decadent flavors.

US,"A lovely Cabernet. It comes from the winery's vineyard in the far southern part of the valley, not far from the Carneros line. The wine is medium-bodied, dry, silky and elegantly tannic, with complex cherry, currant, cola and cedar flavors. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",Cherryblock,92,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"This Cabernet doesn't show any signs of age, even though it's more than four years old. It's still fresh and powerful in tannins, with intensely concentrated blackberry and cassis fruit. With an impeccable structure, it should easily negotiate the next decade. Cellar it.",Monte Rosso,92,70,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"The idea here was to make a white Burgundy-style Chardonnay with lots of oak. But the new oak is so strong that it overshadows what's actually a pretty nice wine underneath. You have to dive down through an ocean of smoky char, woody vanilla and sweet woodsap to find the basic peach and pineapple flavors.",Durell Vineyard,84,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Falcor
US,"Raw in the mouth, with green, stemmy tannins and a chlorophyll taste to the berry-cherry flavors. So it's not quite ripe. But it's dry and okay with barbecue.",,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary.",Ramona Pinot Noir,83,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Nicholson Ranch
US,"This Bordeaux blend is full-bodied and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors, with smoky, oaky notes. Tasted in the winter of 2008, it had a dry, tannic astringency that suggested pairing with rich, marbled meats.

US,"Structure and elegance mark this fine blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The blackberry, cherry and black currant flavors are nicely ripe, yet the wine modulates them with crisp acidity and tannins that have a bite of astringency, which of course suggests roasts and grilled steaks.

US,"There's a sharp, minty smell and taste in this as well as hard tannins and cutting acidity, all of which hint at less-than-ripe grapes. The wine is fully dry, but lacks the sensuality you want in Merlot.",Estate,82,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Wellington
US,"Sharp, minty-peppery and tannicly dry in its youth, this Syrah is rich enough in fruit to warrant some years in the cellar. That could give it time to soften and let the ripe blackberry, chocolate, coffee and gingersnap cookie flavors out. Try 2009–2011.",Estate,88,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Petroni
US,"Consumers need to be warned that this Zin has 16.3% alcohol, which puts it nearly in Port territory. That aside, it's a good example of its style, which lots of people like.

US,"This is a limited production 100% Cab from the winery's estate vineyard. It's much more tannic than Cohn's extraordinarily fine '04 Estate, which was released a year ago. Even at the age of five-plus, it stings with sandpapery astringency. Should easily negotiate the years, with its massive core of blackberries, black currants, olives and 100% new oak. Hold until after 2010, and should develop for many years beyond.",Olive Hill Estate Vineyards Special Selection,93,100,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"Damaris is a wine whose sourcing keeps shifting, from Bien Nacido to Sonoma County. Now it's Sonoma Valley. The wine is dominated by oak, all vanilla and char, but isn't very interesting down below. The flavors are citrusy, just not big enough for a wine with this famous a name.",Damaris Reserve,83,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Landmark

US,"It's silky and gentle in tannins and rich in cherry, tobacco, pine and spice flavors that finish dry. It's also sharper in acids than many other red wines, but that's what helps Sangiovese cut through rich cheeses and meats, and stand up to tomato sauce.",Brunello di Sonoma,87,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Petroni
US,"Nice and lush. The flavors of cherry, cassis, anise, milk chocolate and cinnamon spice are just delicious, and there's a good texture, too. Ripe, firm tannins girdle the wine, and just-enough acidity keeps it from tasting candied. Drink now for its youthful babyfat.",V,88,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
US,"Kudos to the winery for picking at low brix and for keeping the residual sugar so low so that the wine is absolutely dry. It lets the palate really appreciate the acid-brightened flavors of exotic fruits, wildflowers, and, especially, Asian spices. The wine could be more concentrated, but it's still a good sipper.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,88,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Gundlach Bundschu

US,"This unoaked wine depends entirely on its origins for richness and complexity, and succeeds. It's brilliantly dry and crisp, with rewarding Meyer lemon, kaffir lime and pineapple flavors that have a piquant touch of tart gooseberry. A beautiful and serious wine, among the best of its type.",,88,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Highway 12

US,"This is an elegant Chardonnay that will pair well with upscale fare, like scallops in a curry cream sauce. It's forward in ripe pineapple, pear, peach and lime flavors, with a smoky, crème brûlée richness that finishes in a swirl of spicy vanilla and smoky oak. Seems at its best now.",Durell Vineyard,92,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Craig

Nice with a grilled steak.",Gregory Vineyard,88,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB

US,"A lovely Chardonnay that's marked by a steely minerality that braces and provides structure to the pineapple, lemondrop, honey and buttered toast flavors. Feels really elegant and creamy in the mouth. Easy to find, with nearly 13,000 cases produced, and a good price for the quality.",,92,29,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"A fine Merlot that shows lots of class at a pretty good price. It's a little rough in texture, but not too much, with sophisticated black cherry, black currant and red plum flavors, made richer with a touch of violets and cedar wood. Give it a good decant before serving.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Highway 12
US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level. The pepper- and mineral-infused flavors suggest peaches and grapefruits, enriched with new oak and lees. This is an extremely dry, food-friendly wine.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,87,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"The vineyard is in the southern part of the valley, near Carneros, and the wine shows fog-influenced acidity that cleans and refreshes the exotic fruit, flower, mineral and spice flavors.

US,"Jammy and direct, this Marsanne has flavors of peaches, limes, honeysuckle and vanilla. It's a simple wine whose acidity will check Asian food or something tasty and sweet, like ham.",Estate,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,Wellington
US,"Ripe, soft and creamy smooth, this Chard has polished flavors of pineapple jam, vanilla, pears, apple butter, honey and cinnamon.",,86,29,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
US,"Partially barrel fermented and aged on the lees, this Chard has a creamy texture, and good flavors of pears, pineapples, figs and vanilla. Brisk acidity makes the finish clean and tart.",,85,17,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,83,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"High in alcohol, with some heat throughout, but the wine wears it well, with huge fruit and a dry finish. Tastes almost desserty, with crème de cassis, milk chocolate, blackberry jam and coffee flavors and a distinct dried thyme and briary nettle edge. Very nice, but wow, that alcohol!",Maggie's Reserve,89,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"This bottling from Kunde is dependable for its dry, crisp elegance. It always shows bright lemongrass and gooseberry fruit, with more exotic notes of litchi and fig. The trick is to control disagreeable greenness, which pops up here in the finish.",Magnolia Lane,86,16,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
US,"Nice and dry, with dusty, earthy flavors of wild berries, nettles, olive tapenade and spices. Has a troubling bit of sharpness that's a bit vinegary, though.",,82,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"Dry and minty, this Pinot has the elegantly silky structure of a fine cool-climate wine. But it's a little thin in the cherry fruit flavors that lift it above the ordinary, and finishes quick.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,85,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gundlach Bundschu
US,Pretty good Cab from this winery; a little thin but rewarding for its soft tannins and good varietal character. The flavors are of blackberries and dried herbs.,,85,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kunde
US,"From the famed Monte Rosso Vineyard Ed Sbragia has crafted a wine that needs time in the cellar. Strong, hard tannins shut down the currant and cherry fruit, making the wine astringent. But it's a very fine mountain Cab, and will reward aging. Should begin to be approachable by 2010, and continue developing for many more years.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,94,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"This very tannic wine is fierce and astringent at this time. It's almost old-fashioned in its puckery dryness. True, it has a deep core of ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and cola flavors that could emerge after sufficient aging, but it's not a certainty.",Estate Grown,85,70,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Petroni
US,"Dry and bitter, this Sangiovese is better than most California bottlings, but has its work cut out for it. It shows a good range of tart cherryskin flavors, with additional flavors of acidic things like espresso and tobacco.",D'Alfonso,85,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,D'Argenzio
US,"This high-altitude vineyard, way above Sonoma Valley, is often the source of tannic, ageworthy reds. In this warm vintage, the grapes grew very ripe, almost raisined, and the wine is soft. It's not going to age. But it's tasty now in black currant and chocolate flavors, and will be nice with barbecue.",Grand Reserve Monte Rosso Vineyard,86,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Villa Mt. Eden
US,"Tough, dry and tannic, with an unrelieved quality, this is a wine that needs serious time in the cellar or major decanting to let it soften. There's a heart of blackberry and pomegranate fruit that should withstand these tests. Even 12 hours of decanting would not be too much.",Syrcab,87,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,B.R. Cohn
US,"Rich and spicy, this Zin has waves of cherry jam, raspberry purée, mocha, cinnamon-pepper spice and vanilla oak flavors. It's so fruity, it's almost sweet, an impression heightened by softness.",,84,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Tastes a bit old for a Chard, with the fruit fading. It's still lively in acids, and has enough pear and apple flavors to satisfy. Finishes quick, and overall, it's not what it should be.",,84,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Deerfield Ranch
US,"Sebastiani knows Barbera. At its best, which this one is, the variety produces a very dry, very tannic and high-acid wine, rich in earthy, coffee, cherry-berry flavors. This bottle, which is robust now, will easily achieve 20 years of age, softening and sweetening all the way.",,87,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Sebastiani
US,"This rustic Zin is meant to wash down grilled meats, hard cheeses and tomato-based pasta dishes. It's very dry and a bit hot in high alcohol, with a peppery edge and firm, rasping tannins.",Meeks Hilltop Ranch,84,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package. But the wine would benefit from more acidity and less sweetness.",Garbiella Ranch,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,VJB
US,"This isn't one of your tropical fruit and oak, acidic cool-climate monster Chards. It's soft and earthy, with a dried sage and oregano edge to the green apple and white peach flavors.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,86,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"This Syrah-Zin blend is forward in jammy raspberry, cherry, herb tea and spice flavors. It's simple, but crisp acidity gives it a firm, clean finish.",Le Pique-Nique,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Wellington
US,"A disappointing wine that opens with starkly unripe, vegetal aromas and never quite overcomes its tough herbaceousness. It's very dry, with rasping tannins and an astringent finish. Tasted twice.",Bismark Ranch,82,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Hanna
US,"and sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and carob flavors. Tasty enough, but seriously lacks the acidity to make this fruity wine come alive. From Cartlidge & Browne.",,83,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moser Scharding
US,"Awkward. Despite some cherry jam and candied licorice flavors, accented by quite a bit of oak, there's a semi-sweet sharpness in the finish reminiscent of cough medicine, and a touch of sweaty funk.",Sonoma Mountain-Top Vineyards,83,54,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bush-Field
US,"Hard in tannins, with a baked, pie-filling quality to the blackberry and black cherry fruit, this bone-dry Syrah is made for drinking now with robust foods, like burgers or lasagna.",England Crest,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Wellington

US,"This mountain Cab is dependably hard in youthful tannins on release. That won't stop most people from drinking it too young, but with its rich, deep cassis flavors, it would be a shame to pop the cork before 2010.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,91,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"Overripe, tannic and sweet like cherry cough drops, this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Sangiovese leaves a lot to be desired.",Danté,82,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
US,"A blend of Bordeaux and Rhône varieties, this is a dry, somewhat rugged wine, whose best feature is fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, even cranberries and cocoa show up in the complex flavors. There's a tannic, acidic streak that makes it a little tough, though.",Tytanium,86,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ty Caton
US,"Like the '05 release, Castle's 2006 is sugary-sweet, with peach and pineapple jelly flavors that taste more like a dessert wine than one for the main course.",Landa Vineyards,82,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Castle
US,"Tastes like fruity soda pop or canned fruit syrup, with sugary pineapple and pear flavors. The oak is unnaturally sweet and strong.",,81,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Castle
US,"From an old field blend said to date to the 1880s. The winery states that the wine also includes Grenache, Petite Sirah, Alicante, Carignane and several other varieties. It's a very complex Zin, with layers of fruits, berries, herbs and spices, and is full-bodied enough for anything from steak to venison. Minor quibble: too sweet despite high alcohol.",Old Hill Ranch,86,34,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bucklin

US,"Made like an old-fashioned Barbera, this one is truculent in tannins, with a full-bodied mouthfeel housing flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, anise and pepper. It will probably live for two decades, gradually sweetening as it throws sediment, but always remaining rustic.",Augusto,87,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Viansa
US,"Fully mature now, although it still has a good six years left, this shows why certain Zins benefit from aging. Tight and tannicly dry to begin with, it has aged to something approaching Pinot-like delicacy, although the wild berry, roasted coffee and spice flavors are Zinny, and few Zinfandels will ever have these tannins.",Stellwagen Vineyard,92,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Decent, everyday Zin, with wild berry and earthy flavors wrapped in thick but easy tannins. Thankfully, it's fully dry, although the alcohol is on the high side, and the wine feels hot in the mouth. There's a sharp tartness in the finish.",,84,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"This seductive, creamy Chard wraps smoky, spicy, vanilla-laden oak flavors around a core of lush tropical fruit. There's lively acidity and a lot to like here. The finish shows a slight edge that may smooth out in another three or four months.",Great Estates,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
US,"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the—oh…I mean…coladas and ripe banana, caramel and pear aromas and flavors, then this wine delivers. There's an undeniable coconut quality here, and nice acid zip that keeps the fruit in the mix. The oak tannins need a bit of time to smooth out—they're a little edgy on the back end.",Parmelee-Hill Vineyard,89,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Steele
US,"Rich and fruity, a voluptuous Cab with flavors of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, with notes of raisins and a nice appliqué of toasty cedar. Good over the next few years.",Maycacamas Mountains,87,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Angels
US,"Easy to imagine drinking this with a really nice lamb dish or grilled steak. It has an upscale feeling, with a complex interplay of tannins and oak, and the flavors are long, lush and liqueur-like. However, it's soft, and not ageable.",,90,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Smells a little funky, with a meaty, raw beef aroma on top of scents of green apples. Tastes thin and watery, with a suggested of appley citrus fruit flavor. The finish turns tart and dry.",Barrel Reserve - Barrel Aged,82,10,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Domaine St. George
US,"What a great job Schug is doing with  Bordeaux varieties. This is an extraordinarily rich Cab, with ripe blackberry flavors folded into thick, fine tannins. There's a cut of acidity that brings balance, and will help the wine age for six years or so. Compared to Napa Cabs, it's more structured and angular, but right up there.",Heritage Reserve,92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"This mountain wine is thick in dusty tannins, and too young to fully enjoy now. But it's a guaranteed ager, with its balance of acids and deep, delicious core of black currant, black cherry, cola and cocoa flavors. It has that extra edge of complexity that makes for a great Cabernet. Drink after 2007.",Reserve,92,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Here's a rich, dense, impressive Cab. It shows soft acids, melted tannins and beautifully ripe cassis, black currant, black cherry pie and milk chocolate flavors, with well-integrated smoky oak notes, and is thoroughly dry. It doesn't seem like an ager, but is delicious now and for the next few years.",Reserve,91,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kunde
US,"Tannic and young and dry. This adolescent Cab is locked down now, but it shows the flash and structure associated with this vineyard. Is it an ager? Hard to tell, because it's more elegant than powerful, and you have to wonder if the fruit will outlive the tannins. The betting is on longevity. Drink 2008–2015.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,90,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
US,"Dry and tannic, this is a little too astringent now (except with barbecue), but it does have a distinguished mouthfeel, with a deep core of cassis, leather, carob, tobacco and spices. Try after 2008.",,87,31,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Peter Cellars

US,"This Bordeaux blend comes from the Carneros-Sonoma Valley border, a cool area. But the vintage was extraordinarily hot, and the wine benefited.

US,"Few wineries in California can craft a Chard as rich, balanced and ageworthy as this. In its youth this ‘05 is flashy in lemondrop, pear and spicy anise, with a honeyed finish and crisp acidity. It's quite addictively brilliant, a wine whose lush harmony mesmerizes the palate. But Hanzell Chards invariably age well, and this is a wine you can dependably put into your cellar for 5, 10, 15 years, even longer, as it continues to evolve and become more limpid and minerally.",,96,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"Among California's First Growth Pinots, Hanzell's ‘04 is marked by a full-bodied, austere density that demands time in the cellar. It's a very dry, fairly tannic wine, rich in ripe crushed black cherry, red cherry candy, tobacco, cedar and spicebox aromas and flavors that are impeccably balanced. Really defines the terroir of the estate, and should develop well. Best 2010 through 2020.",,95,90,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"The texture's all wrong on this wine, because the ripeness levels and tannins are unbalanced. The cherry and wood flavors have streaks of green and jalapeño pepper, and there's some funkiness.",Mountain Cuvée,82,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Spotted Owl
US,"From an old-field blended vineyard with all sorts of varieties, the wine has a real sense of style and place. It's not modernly elegant, but it is a true representative of old-time Sonoma red wine. It's like drinking history.",Casa Santinamaria Vineyards,86,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Saxon Brown

US,"A new bottling from Kunde, and one of their most successful reds ever. A Cabernet-Merlot blend, it shows earthy, tobacco-edged flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, carob, vanilla and cedar. It turns away from the current overripe style in favor of Bordeaux-style balance and elegance. Best now through 2008.",202,92,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Meritage,Kunde
US,"Very rich and juvenile now, with exotic cherry, blackberry, gingerbread, tangerine, herb tea, vanilla oak and spice flavors, this Zin has a thick, tannic intensity that needs time to mature. The power and concentration must come from the mountain vineyard, on the eastern side of the valley. Hold this dramatic, high-alcohol Zinfandel until mid-2008, at least.",Arrowhead Mountain Vineyard,92,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,JC Cellars
US,"Kunde has a remarkable consistency with their estate Viognier, and the ‘06 shows off the variety at its best.

Try as an alternative to a rich Sauvignon Blanc.",,90,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Kunde
US,"This is the driest, most concentrated and sophisticated of Kenwood's current trio of Merlots, and also the only one that will benefit from cellaring.

US,"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes.

US,"For decades Hanzell has been making one of California's most (and only) ageworthy Chards. The '03 is one for the cellar, but it comes at the price of being hard in youth.

US,"Despite the elaborations that have been lavished on this wine, from carefully selected, biodynamically grown grapes, new oak and malolactic fermentation, the wine feels soft and thin in fruit, leading to a hot, tannic finish.",Reserve,83,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Benziger
US,"This bottling has got to be one of the most seriously underpriced Cabs in California.

Gets better as it breathes in the glass.",Réserve Spéciale,93,110,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
US,"This is a strongly flavored young wine. There's nothing subtle about the blast of blackberries, cherries and currants, of the sweet, smoky oak.

This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,91,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Atmosphere

Really stylish for drinking now.",Serres Ranch,91,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Highway 12
US,"Rhône white blends are among the toughest to pull off in California, but Atmosphere does a terrific job.

It's rich and complex enough to put on the table beside a fine meal, and while it's not quite in the league of a cult Syrah, on the other hand it won't demand all the attention.

It's brilliantly dry and crisp, with rewarding Meyer lemon, kaffir lime and pineapple flavors that have a piquant touch of tart gooseberry. A beautiful and serious wine, among the best of its type.",,88,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Highway 12
US,"A first-rate Sauvignon Blanc. Bone dry and crisp and clean in mouthwatering acidity, it has wonderfully complex gooseberry, lime, grapefruit and kiwi flavors. Among the top of its class, and a great value.",Demark St. Vineyard Tribute,92,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Atmosphere
US,"Tightly wound, with oak sticking out, big tannins and a solid inner core of vibrant, red cherry and red currant fruit. There's a fine wine in here, but it just needs a few years to come out. Drink 2011–2014.",Reserve,90,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kunde
US,"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,95,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"This is a dry, soft Syrah with some dusty tannins you'll have to negotiate, but a grilled steak, or almost anything with a BBQ char, should do well. The underlying flavors are delicious, a wealth of blackberries, cherries, currants, datenut cookie, licorice and Asian spices. Drink now.",Jack London Vineyard,89,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Kenwood
US,"Great price for a Zin of this purity and varietal truth. Dry and medium-bodied, but sweet in fruit, it shows wonderful flavors of wild forest blackberries, with complications from black pepper, orange peel, anise and Asian spices. The texture is sheer velvet. Best now and through 2010.",,90,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cline
US,"A fine Merlot that shows lots of class at a pretty good price. It's a little rough in texture, but not too much, with sophisticated black cherry, black currant and red plum flavors, made richer with a touch of violets and cedar wood. Give it a good decant before serving.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Highway 12
US,"This new 100% Cab from the esteemed winemaker, Richard Arrowood, is made in the modern, cult style, which is to say it has high alcohol, soft acids and gentle tannins, and has lush, almost decadent flavors. They suggest milk chocolate, raspberries, cherries and currants, with spicy, smoky, caramelized notes from new oak.",Amapola Creek Estate,89,100,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Amapola Creek
US,"Here's a Cab that needs food to round it off and polish its rough edges. Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries.",Heritage Reserve,89,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies.",Los Chamizal,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hopper Creek
US,"A little too sweet for a dry table wine, with sugary flavors of tropical citrus fruits, coconut macaroon and vanilla sponge cake. Almost a dessert wine, but clean and vibrant on the finish, and quite delicious.",Estate Vineyard,86,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,Wellington
US,"This Bordeaux blend is full-bodied and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors, with smoky, oaky notes. Tasted in the winter of 2008, it had a dry, tannic astringency that suggested pairing with rich, marbled meats. Should develop in the bottle through 2012.",Rhinefarm Vineyard Mountain Cuvée,88,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Gundlach Bundschu

Drink now with Vietnamese food or sushi.",Denmark Street Vineyard Tribute,88,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Atmosphere

US,"A bit too soft, and that absence of structure makes the ripe pineapple jam and vanilla custard flavors taste simple. Lots of people will like the exotic richness.",Coriol,86,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rhône-style White Blend,Anaba
US,"Sharp, minty-peppery and tannicly dry in its youth, this Syrah is rich enough in fruit to warrant some years in the cellar.

US,"Consumers need to be warned that this Zin has 16.3% alcohol, which puts it nearly in Port territory. That aside, it's a good example of its style, which lots of people like. Dry and well-structured in acids and tannins, it shows rich flavors of red and black currants, anise, cola and crushed pepper.",Monto Rosso Vineyard Viñas Antiguas,87,55,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Amapola Creek
US,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",Reserve,88,33,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"Very rich, spicy and full-bodied for a rosé. The raspberry and strawberry flavors have a grilled, caramelized quality, making for a slightly sweet finish. Fortunately, there is high acidity, giving this high octane rosé needed crispness.",Tempranillo,88,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Rosé,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"A very ripe Zinfandel that shows plenty of briary, brambly aromas and flavors and a robust mouthfeel.

The pineapple, pear and flowery honeysuckle flavors are accented with richer touches of buttered toast from oak barrels.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,88,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Deerfield Ranch
US,"Very forward and mouth-filling in pineapples, mangoes, nectarines, guavas and figs. Yet the wine is dry and crisp. Shows flamboyance rather than complexity, and will appeal to fans of this hedonistic style.",Durell Vineyard,87,47,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Saxon Brown
US,"It's silky and gentle in tannins and rich in cherry, tobacco, pine and spice flavors that finish dry. It's also sharper in acids than many other red wines, but that's what helps Sangiovese cut through rich cheeses and meats, and stand up to tomato sauce.",Brunello di Sonoma,87,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Petroni

US,"With its peppery spices and briary, brambly notes of ripe wild berries, this wine tastes more like Zinfandel than Merlot. It's not true to the variety, but it is a solid red wine, dry and full-bodied.",Estate,86,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Wellington
US,"A good, soft wine to drink now with a steak or chop. It's full-bodied and very rich in extracted blackberry jam and crème de cassis flavor, with touches of pepper, cocoa and bacon.",Jack London Vineyard,87,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Kenwood
US,"Very good for its complexity, although it's tough and tannic, and the acidity sticks out. The blackberry, currant and cherry flavors are rich and nuanced, but the wine feels hard and sharp. Odds are the lifespan is six years: cellar or decant.",Three Blocks,87,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Signaterra Benziger

US,"Despite the “valley” appellation, this is one of the highest elevation vineyards in Sonoma County. It's a dense, tannic, concentrated wine, with a deep core of black currants, black pepper and chocolate. Zinfanatics will absolutely love it, but it's very high in alcohol, almost Port-like, although the finish is absolutely dry.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,88,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna

US,"This very tannic wine is fierce and astringent at this time. It's almost old-fashioned in its puckery dryness. True, it has a deep core of ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and cola flavors that could emerge after sufficient aging, but it's not a certainty.",Estate Grown,85,70,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Petroni
US,"Dry and bitter, this Sangiovese is better than most California bottlings, but has its work cut out for it. It shows a good range of tart cherryskin flavors, with additional flavors of acidic things like espresso and tobacco.",D'Alfonso,85,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,D'Argenzio

US,"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness.",Los Chamizal Vineyards,85,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hopper Creek

US,"Few wineries in California can craft a Chard as rich, balanced and ageworthy as this. In its youth this ‘05 is flashy in lemondrop, pear and spicy anise, with a honeyed finish and crisp acidity. It's quite addictively brilliant, a wine whose lush harmony mesmerizes the palate. But Hanzell Chards invariably age well, and this is a wine you can dependably put into your cellar for 5, 10, 15 years, even longer, as it continues to evolve and become more limpid and minerally.",,96,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"Among California's First Growth Pinots, Hanzell's ‘04 is marked by a full-bodied, austere density that demands time in the cellar. It's a very dry, fairly tannic wine, rich in ripe crushed black cherry, red cherry candy, tobacco, cedar and spicebox aromas and flavors that are impeccably balanced. Really defines the terroir of the estate, and should develop well. Best 2010 through 2020.",,95,90,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"This Zin shows classic Sonoma County character, but it's also a tannic, young wine that wants a little time in the bottle. Tasted at the age of two, it's astringent and jammy, with pepper-infused blackberry and mulberry flavors and a gamy touch of smoked beef. Give it until mid-2009, when it will be fantastic with grilled beef.",Jack London Vineyard,92,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"Monte Rosso red wines are always big, but this may be the most intense Cabernet ever to come from that mountain vineyard. It's in keeping with the Sbragia style of extreme ripeness and oak. Almost sweet, but really dry, it erupts in black currant, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, and needs time in the cellar to calm down. Best after 2011.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia

US,"Sharpness compromises this wine. Whether the acidity is natural or added, it's intrusive, cutting the palate and giving a sour candy taste to the blackberries, currants and cherries. Ready now.",Gracie Creek Vineyards,85,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Muscardini
US,"Good, rich notes in this blackberry, currant, dark chocolate, roasted meat and black pepper flavored wine, with its firm tannins. Loses points for excessive softness and heat, which gives it a rustic feel. Drink now.",Caton Vineyard Ballfield,84,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Ty Caton
US,"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.",Durell Vineyard,85,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sand Hill

US,"A new bottling from Kunde, and one of their most successful reds ever. A Cabernet-Merlot blend, it shows earthy, tobacco-edged flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, carob, vanilla and cedar.

US,"Very rich and juvenile now, with exotic cherry, blackberry, gingerbread, tangerine, herb tea, vanilla oak and spice flavors, this Zin has a thick, tannic intensity that needs time to mature. The power and concentration must come from the mountain vineyard, on the eastern side of the valley.

US,"Almost all the oak is new or one year old, and the wine tastes and smells over-oaked, with clove, vanilla and caramel notes dominating. Underneath is a high-alcohol wine, whose cherry and blackberry flavors taste hot, sweet and jammy.

US,"Kunde has a remarkable consistency with their estate Viognier, and the ‘06 shows off the variety at its best.

Try as an alternative to a rich Sauvignon Blanc.",,90,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Kunde

US,"Oh, what a rich Zin this is. It's like biting into a chocolate truffle that melts in your mouth. Then comes the blackberry liqueur, cherry pie, cinnamon roll.

US,"The Toreador bottling represents the best Zin winemaker Eric Cinnamon can make from the vineyard. So far, it's been a complex, ageworthy wine, and the '05 continues that tradition.

Very nice, but wow, that alcohol!",Maggie's Reserve,89,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level.

US,"From the pitch-black color you can tell this is an enormously extracted wine. It shows the stuffing of this famous vineyard's Zins, with blackberries, loganberries, cherries, licorice, leather and cocoa-laced coffee, and is quite tannic.

US,"Rich and spicy, this Zin has waves of cherry jam, raspberry purée, mocha, cinnamon-pepper spice and vanilla oak flavors. It's so fruity, it's almost sweet, an impression heightened by softness.",,84,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Despite the elaborations that have been lavished on this wine, from carefully selected, biodynamically grown grapes, new oak and malolactic fermentation, the wine feels soft and thin in fruit, leading to a hot, tannic finish.",Reserve,83,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Benziger
US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package. But the wine would benefit from more acidity and less sweetness.",Garbiella Ranch,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,VJB
US,"and sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and carob flavors. Tasty enough, but seriously lacks the acidity to make this fruity wine come alive. From Cartlidge & Browne.",,83,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moser Scharding
US,"A very good Cabernet, rich and dry, but you'll want to decant it for a few hours to let it soften. Right out of the bottle it's rough, giving a gritty feeling to the ripe blackberries and currants. Drink now–2012.",,88,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clarbec
US,"Awkward. Despite some cherry jam and candied licorice flavors, accented by quite a bit of oak, there's a semi-sweet sharpness in the finish reminiscent of cough medicine, and a touch of sweaty funk.",Sonoma Mountain-Top Vineyards,83,54,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bush-Field
US,"Overripe, tannic and sweet like cherry cough drops, this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Sangiovese leaves a lot to be desired.",Danté,82,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
US,"This bottling has got to be one of the most seriously underpriced Cabs in California. What you get is a firmly structured, tannic, complex 100% Cabernet, rich in currants and oak, that can proudly stand on the best table. Will take some age, too. Best now through 2012.",Olive Hill,93,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"Made like an old-fashioned Barbera, this one is truculent in tannins, with a full-bodied mouthfeel housing flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, anise and pepper. It will probably live for two decades, gradually sweetening as it throws sediment, but always remaining rustic.",Augusto,87,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Viansa
US,"This is a wine that may get lost in a blind tasting because it's restrained and balanced. Fruit bombs will overwhelm it, but with great food, at the table, its simple, dry elegance and refreshingly crisp acidity will support, not overwhelm, steak, lamb, duck or other rich fare.",,91,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Schug
US,"In a time when so many Cabernets are hard to drink with food because they're overextracted, this controlled wine is a welcome find. It's dry, with the alcohol a modest 13.5%. The fruit flavors have a nice earthy, herbal component reminiscent of Bordeaux.",,90,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"Fully mature now, although it still has a good six years left, this shows why certain Zins benefit from aging. Tight and tannicly dry to begin with, it has aged to something approaching Pinot-like delicacy, although the wild berry, roasted coffee and spice flavors are Zinny, and few Zinfandels will ever have these tannins.",Stellwagen Vineyard,92,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"The name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but this is a pretty good wine. Smooth and velvety, with earth-tinged berry, coffee and spice flavors, this gets better as it warms and breathes in the glass.",SyrCab,89,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah-Cabernet,B.R. Cohn
US,"You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin. It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.",Old Hill Single Vineyard,95,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"Easy to imagine drinking this with a really nice lamb dish or grilled steak. It has an upscale feeling, with a complex interplay of tannins and oak, and the flavors are long, lush and liqueur-like. However, it's soft, and not ageable.",,90,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Rich and fruity, a voluptuous Cab with flavors of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, with notes of raisins and a nice appliqué of toasty cedar. Good over the next few years.",Maycacamas Mountains,87,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Angels
US,"New oak seems to dominate this Chard, swamping the actual flavor of the wine. The grapes provide lovely apricots and pineapples, balanced with fine acidity, but the oak swamps with smoke and vanilla and sappy wood cream.",Damaris Reserve,84,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Landmark
US,"Simple and sweet. This Sauvignon has sugary flavors of pineapples, limes, peaches and apples, and benefits from crisp acidity.",,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wellington
US,"A beautiful Zinfandel that shows the variety's spicy, briary personality in a balanced, elegant way. Dry and rich in brisk tannins, it has complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, sweet tobacco, anise, cola, cocoa, sandalwood and dusty spices. Drink now–2013 before it starts to lose its fruit.",Barricia Single Vineyard,93,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"Ripe and balanced, a nice, clean Merlot to drink now with savory sausages. It's dry and tannic, with flavors of black cherries, black currants, cola and sandalwood, and a dusty, mouthwatering coating of Asian spices.",,87,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Wellington
US,"Simple and superoaky, with strong flavors of vanilla and char dominating an otherwise average Chard. Under all that smoky wood you'll find a wine of modest peach, pineapple and apricot flavors.",,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Wellington
US,"Jammy and direct, this Marsanne has flavors of peaches, limes, honeysuckle and vanilla. It's a simple wine whose acidity will check Asian food or something tasty and sweet, like ham.",Estate,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne,Wellington
US,"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,83,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"From one of the highest vineyards in Sonoma County, this is a tannic wine, although the tannins, in the modern style, are soft and intricate. It's oaky, soft and quite extracted, with a black currant syrup mouthfeel.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,85,61,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"Solid enough, with forward aromas of grapefruit, lime and river stones. Despite the fact that it was barrel fermented, it isn't an oaky wine. Just the opposite; there's tart, fresh citrus at all check points and nary a wood note except for some faint butter.",Peterson Vineyard,87,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Deerfield Ranch
US,"The label points out that this is barrel fermented, but a sniff and sip will tell you that much. The nose pumps petrol at first and then plenty of smoky wood. In the mouth, it's immensely round and chewy, with vanilla, coconut, banana and peach flavors. Broad but zesty enough, which allows the heavy toast element to work.",Vadasz Vineyard,87,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Nice and dry, with dusty, earthy flavors of wild berries, nettles, olive tapenade and spices. Has a troubling bit of sharpness that's a bit vinegary, though.",,82,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wellington
US,"A Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend that shows lots of fruity character and real elegance. Dry and soft, the blackberry, cassis, cherry and sweet oak flavors are delicious. Drink now.",Red Wine,88,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Eponymous
US,"This Bordeaux blend is straightforward, offering ripe, juicy flavors of blackberries, cherries, anise, mocha and cedar, with an exotic hint of Chinese plum sauce. Finishes dry and clean. Drink now.",Red Wine,86,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Eponymous
US,"From the famed Monte Rosso Vineyard Ed Sbragia has crafted a wine that needs time in the cellar. Strong, hard tannins shut down the currant and cherry fruit, making the wine astringent. But it's a very fine mountain Cab, and will reward aging. Should begin to be approachable by 2010, and continue developing for many more years.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,94,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
US,"A big, softly tannic wine that can be consumed with pleasure now or held up to 10 years, this shows classic aromas and flavors of smoke, cassis and vanilla and a long, fruit-driven finish.",Jack London Vineyard,90,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"I have tasted a number of bottle-aged Hanzell Chardonnays, and when properly cellared from a good vintage, they are totally amazing. This is likely to be such a wine, but right now, it's tight, tart and earthy, with hints of peach. It's not a mind blower, but is a Chard for those serious about their cellars. Best after 2010.",,90,55,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
US,"There's so much heat in this 16% alcohol Zin. Granted, it's fully dry, with a smooth, voluptuous texture, and quite delicious in berry and mocha fruit flavors. Classic Zin in its own right, but oh, that alcohol!",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,86,51,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna
US,"This mountain wine is thick in dusty tannins, and too young to fully enjoy now. But it's a guaranteed ager, with its balance of acids and deep, delicious core of black currant, black cherry, cola and cocoa flavors. It has that extra edge of complexity that makes for a great Cabernet. Drink after 2007.",Reserve,92,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,"Lovely when first poured, this belted out rich cassis and vanilla scents alongside aged notes of leather and dried spices. Silky and medium-bodied, with a long, elegant finish. Several minutes later, it started to fade. Drink up.",Jack London Vineyard,89,,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"An interesting wine, with some green herbal elements on the nose, but also a plump, expansive mouthfeel and ripe flavors of chocolate and plum. Still shows some tannins on the finish. Drink now–2010.",Jack London Vineyard,89,,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"This Cab, from a vintage that has been criticized for a perceived lack of longevity, is still chugging right along. Smoky and toasty on the nose, it adds flavors of superripe fruit on the palate: dates, figs and prunes. Richly textured, with a long, still-chewy finish. Drink now–2010.",Jack London Vineyard,89,,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"A bold, almost jammy Cabernet, with vibrant blackberry and cassis flavors that virtually conceal the underlying structure. Seems destined to be enjoyed young.",Jack London Vineyard,89,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Just beginning to drop its fruit, making the focus now on earth and tobacco flavors. This doesn't seem as ripe as the '94, but shows a bit more structure, ending on a slightly astringent note. Drink up.",Jack London Vineyard,88,,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"This mountain Cab is dependably hard in youthful tannins on release. That won't stop most people from drinking it too young, but with its rich, deep cassis flavors, it would be a shame to pop the cork before 2010.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,91,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna
US,"You're struck by the darkness of this wine. Also it's aroma, which is deep and brooding, like something from a vault. In the mouth, the wine is dry and tannic, intended for the cellar. And with its vast core of black cherry and pomegranate fruit and clean balance, it seems destined to ride out the years. Best after 2009 and beyond.",St. Jean Estate Vineyard,90,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Malbec,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Sebastiani knows Barbera. At its best, which this one is, the variety produces a very dry, very tannic and high-acid wine, rich in earthy, coffee, cherry-berry flavors. This bottle, which is robust now, will easily achieve 20 years of age, softening and sweetening all the way.",,87,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Sebastiani
US,"Reined in and tight, but with solid potential given another few years of cellaring. Smoke, earth and herbal notes accent cassis and black cherry fruit. Crisp and firm on the finish, but should bloom by 2008.",Jack London Vineyard,87,,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Although a very good wine, this bottling is not in the same league as the sumptuous '01. It's more tannic and less fruity, although the cassis and cherry fruit that's there is delicious. This is one to drink now while your agers are in the cellar.",,87,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kamen Estate
US,"Pleasing, but basically straightforward. It's all on the surface, but the cherries and oak, vanilla and woodspice come together in a satisfying swirl of dusty tannins.",,86,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Leveroni
US,"Fans of oak will exult over this spicy, Burgundian wine. It's slathered with char, honey, butterscotch and vanilla. Still, there's some rich pineapple fruit underneath, and good acidity.",Durell Vineyard,89,38,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Craig
US,"How dark this wine is, and how young. Primary fruit  is blackberries, with strong charry oak aromas. In the mouth it's clean and vibrant, but immature, hung with blackberry and cherry baby fat. Try aging this lovely wine until 2010 and beyond.",Appellation Selection,88,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Sebastiani
US,"Rather earthy, with some cherry-berry flavors and a good deal of peppery spice, this Syrah is very dry. It's a good provincial wine.",Parmalee-Hill Vineyard,84,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Steele
US,"Good as it is, this wine is having acidity problems, meaning it's overly soft and melted. Yes, it has delicious flavors of black cherries, chocolate and oak, and the tannins are smooth and luxurious, but what about balance?",Sunny Slope Vineyard,85,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Imagery
US,"On the leaner, more herbal side of the spectrum, with cherry flavors spiced with a piny or resinous green note. Finishes a bit hard and astringent, but not likely to improve with age, so enjoy it now with rare steak.",Jack London Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"As good as this wine is, in my opinion Cabernet Franc by itself cannot make a great wine. It's certainly delicious, with cherry, currant, pecan pie and vanilla flavors, and the tannins are soft, sweet and complex. But it lacks the depth that a darker varietal, like Cabernet, brings to the table.",Estate Vineyard,88,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Chateau St. Jean

US,"On the downhill slide, this still packs in enough tobacco, earth, molasses and prune flavor to remain pleasurable.",Jack London Vineyard,84,,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Clearly stands above the competition for its exquisite harmony. Completely dry but totally ripe, with well-developed spicy blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, and wonderfully rich, sweet tannins. So balanced, you don't notice the 15.6 percent alcohol. Only in California, and a world class wine.",Reserve Pagani Vineyard,93,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis
US,"Here's a good, easy-drinking Zin with some pleasant black cherry, tobacco and spice flavors that are wrapped in firm, dusty tannins. It's very dry and balanced in acidity and wood, and will be versatile with everything from pizza to pork.",Old Vines,86,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Sebastiani
US,"One sniff and you know the grapes were baked. Smells like that gummy filling that burbles over the edge of a cherry pie in the oven. In the mouth, it's a little more forgiving, but still finishes with the taste of raisins.",,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Leveroni
US,"The texture is smooth and fine, the tannins just right, but the fruitiness is too upfront, in your face. There's just unrestrained gobs of cherries and jammy berries. Whatever happened to balance?",,83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Leveroni
US,"A difficult vintage that should have been drunk in its youth, the '98 shows a strong herbal component, lacks fruit and features a clipped, high-acid finish.",Jack London Vineyard,83,,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Getting pretty old for a Chard, this wine has lost much of its primary fruit and is turning earthy and fragile. There's an old-lees taste, for aficionados of slightly mature whites.",Parmelee-Hill Vineyard,83,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Steele
US,"Rather tough and tannic, and very dry, with modulated berry and herb flavors. By itself this wine isn't showing much. It really needs something rich, like lamb or steak, to stimulate it.",Jack London Vineyard,86,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"Dry and tannic, this is a little too astringent now (except with barbecue), but it does have a distinguished mouthfeel, with a deep core of cassis, leather, carob, tobacco and spices. Try after 2008.",,87,31,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Peter Cellars
US,"These old vines have yielded an extraordinarily dark, dense wine, the quintessence of black cherry flavors, but weighty with currants. It's extremely dry and pretty tannic, with a puckery grapeskin finish, and should age well. Try this interesting wine as an alternative to Zinfandel.",Old Vines Noir de Noirs,92,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Alicante Bouschet,Wellington
US,"You don't expect much elegance or breed from a Barbera, but this Cabernet-like wine has both. It's rich in plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors, and has very gentle but complex tannins. Feels smooth on the palate, with a firm finish. Nice now, and will age for a decade or two.",Appellation Selection,90,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Sebastiani
US,"Oh, how tough this wine is now. It's like a mummy, wrapped in tannins. It would be easy to pass it by until you notice the intensity of cherry-blackberry fruit. Despite its age, the wine is still aggressively young. Will it soften and improve with cellaring? Probably. Try in 2009.",Reserve,90,90,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
US,"Way too sweet for a table wine. Hard to tell if it's the 16% alcohol or residual sugar, maybe both. Too soft.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,81,51,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna
US,"Very tough and austere, a young wine buried under layers of oak and powerful tannins. Doesn't provide a great deal of pleasure now, but there is a powerful core of black cherry fruit that hits midpalate and kicks in on the finish. Seems to be an ager.",Mountain Terraces,89,27,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Audelssa Sonoma
US,"A mere 174 cases of this wine were produced. It shares the essence of the '03 Monte Rosso Zin, reviewed below, but is richer and more concentrated, as well as much higher in alcohol, pushing 16%. Thoroughly dry, with flavors of coffee, dried blackberries, bitter chocolate and cloves, this is a complex, impressive wine.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Toreador,92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rancho Zabaco
US,"Lovely, delicately silky, light-bodied and elegant, with charm and finesse. Some may find it lean in fruit, which emphasizes the acidity, but it's a connoisseur's Pinot Noir that gets better as it breathes. You have to understand complexity and subtlety in this variety to appreciate this bone-dry, cherry skin-tart wine. Best now through 2010.",Chris Lee Vineyard,92,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"What a great job Schug is doing with  Bordeaux varieties. This is an extraordinarily rich Cab, with ripe blackberry flavors folded into thick, fine tannins. There's a cut of acidity that brings balance, and will help the wine age for six years or so. Compared to Napa Cabs, it's more structured and angular, but right up there.",Heritage Reserve,92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"Here's a rich, dense, impressive Cab. It shows soft acids, melted tannins and beautifully ripe cassis, black currant, black cherry pie and milk chocolate flavors, with well-integrated smoky oak notes, and is thoroughly dry. It doesn't seem like an ager, but is delicious now and for the next few years.",Reserve,91,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kunde
US,"Strikes all the right high-end Cabernet notes. Ripe, plush black currant and cassis fruit, lush, soft tannins, balanced acids and a fine overlay of oak all combine for a rich mouthfeel. The quick finish suggests drinking now.",Drummond Vineyard,88,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kunde
US,"Tannic and young and dry. This adolescent Cab is locked down now, but it shows the flash and structure associated with this vineyard. Is it an ager? Hard to tell, because it's more elegant than powerful, and you have to wonder if the fruit will outlive the tannins. The betting is on longevity. Drink 2008–2015.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,90,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
US,"This is a very good wine, but a young one. It tastes immature now, with its brash, dusty tannins that hide the underlying plum, currant and herb flavors. Even with the softness of its acids, it calls for time in the cellar to open up its hidden treasures. Try after 2005.",Nuns Canyon Reserve,92,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
US,"For a variety with little identity in California,  this one has plenty of personality. It's nutty and creamy, with detailed flavors of citrus rind and peach and a rich, but balancing, overlay of oak. It's also very dry with good acidity.",Tyla's Point Vineyards,90,19,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Sharp Cellars
US,"The vineyard is on the border of Sonoma Valley and Carneros, and this complex Cab shows signs of warm and cool influences. The fruit is rich in cassis, currant and cocoa, but there's a firm tannin and acid structure that gives balance. It's not an ager, so drink now.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,89,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"Easily merits its reserve status due to the upscale, velvety texture, rich, oaky fruit flavors and overall balance that, combined, offer impressive pleasure.",Reserve,90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"This richly flavorful wine is smoky and lush, with hints of cassis and black cherry and dusty spices. It is very dry, with soft, easy but complex tannins, and leaves a lingering aftertaste. Excellent, and would score higher except for a bit of thinness in the middle that lavish oak does not cover.",Jack London Vineyard - 25th Anniversary,90,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood

US,"A gorgeous nose of blackberry, cedar, and cinnamon opens seamlessly into the robust yet elegant palate. Rich cassis, licorice, and cinnamon-toast flavors abound and the mouthfeel is suave. The tangy finish shows dusty tannins, big chocolate and black-cherry flavors. Well structured, it needs three to five years; should age well.",Heritage Reserve,94,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"A can't-miss Cabernet with a rich nose of blackberry, plum, coffee and oak. It's so dense that the cassis, wood, and coffee flavors come across as being tarry.

Simply put, it's full of style and a whole lot of fun to drink.",Monte Rosso Vyd,93,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
US,"Score one for Sonoma Valley and this winery, as the '97 exceeds previous efforts. Lots of enticing deep-berry aromas touched up with leather, dill, and an array of other spices and herbs, even oregano. It's one of those rock-solid winners where the whole is more profound than the parts.",Moon Mountain Reserve,93,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carmenet
US,"The roaring nose shows enormous concentration and depth, with licorice, plum and oak shadings. The mouthfeel is big and jammy, but the fruit is well defined, with a sweet-tart quality and dark coffee accents. Almost seems overmature, but truly flavorful and inviting already.",Batto Vyd,93,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bartholomew Park
US,"A stylish Cab, with ripe aromas and flavors of blackberries, licorice and herbs, wrapped in smoky oak. Drinks dry, polished and smooth. A bit lean, especially considering the vintage, but balanced and elegant.",Heritage Reserve,89,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schug
US,"The acids hit you first. They perk up a creamy wine with pleasant flavors of cherries, cola, mocha and spice. It's dry and balanced. The impression is of a lovely Pinot that combines delicacy and elegance with power. Drink now and over the next four years.",,90,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
US,"Dark, robust, dry, full bodied, tannic and acidic. That pretty much sums up this old-fashioned, young wine. It's a serious cellar candidate, stuffed with blackberry jam, leather and coffee flavors. Best after 2010 and for years beyond.",Artist Collection,88,31,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Imagery
US,"Some coffee and cola aromas add excitement to the otherwise black-fruit nose. The big cassis and plum flavors on the palate are rich enough to elicit tastes and textures of chocolate. A very pleasurable drink-me-now wine, with a fine bitterness to the finish.",Jack London Vyd,91,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Taut but complex aromatics of black plum, chocolate, soy, and cedar open this very dark-hued contender. The oak here is lavish, and the wine appeals with its dark-cherry and toast flavors. Closes with a dry, evenly tannic finish. The insistent heavy toast makes it perhaps a bit of a one-noter, but it's a good example of this popular style.",Reserve,90,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Francis
US,"Big and lush, this one's got gobs of chocolate, plum, spice, black cherry, spice, coffee, herb, toast, and vanilla, all framed in creamy smooth tannins that give a supple quality to the blend. Long, lush and smooth at the end.",Samsel Vineyard/Maggie's Reserve,90,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"This high-altitude vineyard, way above Sonoma Valley, is often the source of tannic, ageworthy reds. In this warm vintage, the grapes grew very ripe, almost raisined, and the wine is soft. It's not going to age. But it's tasty now in black currant and chocolate flavors, and will be nice with barbecue.",Grand Reserve Monte Rosso Vineyard,86,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Villa Mt. Eden
US,"An unmistakable meatiness marks the nose, and then there's some Middle Eastern spices like cumin and coriander. Earthy and full of black-fruit flavor, with oak pouring in late. Try to ignore the bulky young tannins; assume the wine will mature and find its stride down the road.",Alta Vista Vyds,89,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bartholomew Park

Classic Sonoma Zin in its expressive exuberance and unpolished likeability.",Los Chamizal Vineyard,88,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Haywood
US,"Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium.",Olive Hill Estate Vyds Special,88,100,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"Tobacco and pepper combine to create slight stable aromas. Black- and red-berry fruit is chunky, with a mild burn. More rustic than refined, with a dry, clipped finish. If you like your Cabs big and viscous, try this one.",Kasper Vyd,88,41,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bartholomew Park
US,"Candied red fruits and a weedy note on the nose immediately indicate that this is on a different track. There's good fruit with raspberry and plum flavors and a juicy, almost creamy texture. Finishes with tart red-berry flavors; it is pretty, but doesn't have the weight or flavor range to rate higher. Drink now.",Rancho Salina Vyd,87,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Imagery
US,"Always a good bet, this single-vineyard wine bursts from the glass with grass and hay aromas, citrus fruits, vanilla and creamy, smoky notes. It's superrich in the mouth, with tons of ripe peach and tangerine flavors and a hint of honeyed sweetness, but it's basically dry. A fine partner for toasted sourdough rounds topped with goat cheese and olive tapenade. Editors' Choice.",Magnolia Lane,87,13,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
US,"Nice and ripe in blackberry, currant, cherry, coffee, tobacco and herb flavors, this Cab has fairly aggressive tannins that may soften with a year or two of bottle age. The fruity flavors finish very dry and balanced, with some complexity.",Dante,85,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
US,"Tastes like good grapes forced into over-production, to judge from the watery finish. It's still a good wine, with blackcurrant flavors, but you wish it was more intense, especially from this historic label.",Jack London Vineyard,85,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
US,"Slightly sweet in spearmint gum and lemonade flavors, this wine has decent acidity. It leaves the mouth clean and refreshed.",,84,14,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wellington
US,"This seductive, creamy Chard wraps smoky, spicy, vanilla-laden oak flavors around a core of lush tropical fruit. There's lively acidity and a lot to like here. The finish shows a slight edge that may smooth out in another three or four months.",Great Estates,90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
US,"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the—oh…I mean…coladas and ripe banana, caramel and pear aromas and flavors, then this wine delivers. There's an undeniable coconut quality here, and nice acid zip that keeps the fruit in the mix. The oak tannins need a bit of time to smooth out—they're a little edgy on the back end.",Parmelee-Hill Vineyard,89,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Steele
US,"Starts off with herbaceous aromas, including mint, but plenty of swirling releases riper ones of black cherries and cocoa. There's a pretty texture, with soft but firm tannins and soft acidity. It's not especially fruity, but it's sleek and elegant, and rich foods will certainly wake up some of its sleeping sweetness.",Block Collection - Shorenstein Vineyard,85,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Geyser Peak
US,"Ripe and full-bodied with tiers of fruit flavors ranging from green apples and peaches to pears and mango. None-too-subtle oak adds vanilla, smoke and butterscotch elements. Just enough residual sugar for it to drink a bit like an orange-vanilla milk shake.",,88,16,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"This wine typically starts life out as a young, tannic puppy, and although it has ripe flavors and a suppleness that can handle rich meats and cheeses, it's best to cellar it. This vintage is quite undeveloped, wrapped in tannic astringency, but with a hopeful core of fruit that should age well from 2008 on.",Oliver Hill Estate Vineyards,90,65,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
US,"Tough, dry and tannic, with an unrelieved quality, this is a wine that needs serious time in the cellar or major decanting to let it soften. There's a heart of blackberry and pomegranate fruit that should withstand these tests. Even 12 hours of decanting would not be too much.",Syrcab,87,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,B.R. Cohn
US,"A blend of Bordeaux and Rhône varieties, this is a dry, somewhat rugged wine, whose best feature is fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, even cranberries and cocoa show up in the complex flavors. There's a tannic, acidic streak that makes it a little tough, though.",Tytanium,86,39,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ty Caton
US,"Extracted, tannic, dark and dense, with briary, jammy fruit and thick tannins. Blackberries and chocolate, set off with lots of acid. It's a sensational, balanced, bold, ageworthy Zin.",Pagani Reserve,91,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,St. Francis
US,"The winery claims the vines date back to 1882; the wine is a stunner, with rich, old vine complexity mixing cherries, leafy old-vine flavors, smooth chocolaty oak. Smooth, seductive, delicious.",Shaw Vineyard Century Vines,90,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Ripe, round, toasty wine, with rich, plummy fruit and a full-throttle palate feel. Nicely made and surprisingly evolved; jammy and pleasure-packed. Finishes with a pleasing fruit sweetness.",Monte Rosso Vineyard Grand Reserve,90,21,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Villa Mt. Eden
US,"Ripe, strawberry/raspberry preserves, with a pleasing, jammy, fruity, luscious richness. Ten percent Petite Sirah adds color and punch. There's a fair amount of tannin, but overall a nice balance, and the plush fruit is the highlight.",,89,19,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Castle
US,"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourvèdre in it. Interesting and flavorful, though not entirely varietal in character. The mix of spices tastes a bit like a Provençal wine, and it's delicious for the price.",,89,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
US,"Big, ripe, chocolaty wine, with lots of forward, smooth, oaky flavors. Easy to like, with a plush, creamy mouthfeel, and tons of new oak flavor.",Bismark Ranch,88,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna
US,"Interesting cedar, game and leather notes accent this wine's blackberry and chocolate aromas and flavors. There's an almost Rhône-like quality to this full-bodied, well-balanced wine. Produced from a certified organic vineyard, the finish displays dark cherry and chocolate flavors with peppery accents.",Upper Weise Vineyard,86,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"This solid, mainstream Zinfandel displays blackberry fruit and some creamy notes on the nose. Well-defined, dark berry flavors with white pepper and leather accents mark the palate. The mouthfeel is even and the finish here is brisk, tart and juicy. A touch less oak might let the fruit shine a bit more.",Jack London Vineyard,86,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
US,"Dark, oaky, and fine in every respect. Sonoma Valley, often underrated as Merlot country, lends the fruit a very deep and satisfying blackberry component, which is highlighted, in this case, by toasty oak. The tannins are soft and finely etched. Gorgeous stuff, quite lovely now, but the solid core of fruit indicates mid-term aging potential.",Massara Vineyard,92,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
US,"The workhorse wine from this Pinot master is pretty darned good, especially considering the price. Lovely, deep aromas of black cherry, tobacco, coffee and nutmeg, with a waft of vanilla-tinged oak introduce a wine that is ripe and sweet in the mouth. The vintage was a good one, and the fruit is really succulent. It's not a keeper, however, and it won't improve in the cellar, but it's so good there's no reason not to drink it all up now.",,90,15,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
US,"A clean, well made wine displaying Cab Franc's herbaceous, earthy, and spicy-floral side.  Drinks on the lean side, with some spare, delicate berry fruit; it definitely needs food to bring out its best qualities.  Very dry.",,84,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Nelson
